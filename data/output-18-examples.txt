array_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `A[i]` is always equal to `i`. This can be expressed as follows:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 10,024; i++) {
  A[i] = i;
}
//@ assert \forall integer k; 0 <= k < i ==> A[k] == k;
//@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer k; 0 <= k < i ==> A[k] == k;
```

In this code, the assertion `A[10,023] != 10,023` is true because when `i = 10,024`, we have not yet reached that index in the array.
array3.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant i < N;

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true until the end. The condition `A[i] != 0` ensures that we don't exceed the array bounds, as long as `i` stays within the range `[0, N)`.
diamond_2-2.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant y : X ; 

where X = ((y % 2) * (x - 1)) + (x % 2).

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration and after each execution of the body. It states that the remainder when x divided by 2 equals the remainder when y divided by 2.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
underapprox_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `y` at each iteration is equal to `2^(x-1)`.

This can be expressed in ACSL format as:

//@ loop invariant \forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> y == (1 << i);
//@ loop invariant mask : X;

Here, `(1 << i)` represents the binary number with a `1` at position `i`, and all other positions are `0`. The expression `2^(x-1)` is equivalent to this because it's equal to `2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^(x-2)`, which corresponds to the binary representation `(1 << 0) | (1 << 1) | ... | (1 << x-2)`.
even.c
The loop invariant for this code is:

// @loop invariant x : (x % 2) == 0;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every increment operation inside the loop body, `x` will always be even. This property holds true because in each iteration, we are adding an even number to `x`, so it remains even.

//@ loop invariant mask : (x % 2) == 0;
linear-inequality-inv-a.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant s == sum_of_v_from_0_to_i ; 

where `sum_of_v_from_0_to_i` represents the cumulative sum of all values in the array from index 0 to i. This invariant holds at the beginning and end of each iteration, as well as after the loop finishes.

The initial condition is that s = 0 (since it's initialized before the loop), which means `sum_of_v_from_0_to_i` also equals 0 initially.

At the end of each iteration, v is added to s (`s += v;`) and i is incremented by 1 (`i++;`). This ensures that `sum_of_v_from_0_to_i` remains equal to s at all times during the loop.
deep-nested.c
The loop invariant is that the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are all less than `uint32_max - 1`.

//@ loop invariant mask : a <= uint32_max-2 && b < uint32_max-1 && c < uint32_max-1 && d < uint32_max-1 && e < uint32_max-1;
nested_1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `a` at each iteration remains unchanged, i.e., it stays equal to its initial value.

So, the computed invariant is:

//@ loop invariant a == 6;
// @loop invariant mask : a == 6 ;
benchmark01_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 0 <= x + y ; 
This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the last iteration (i.e., when the loop terminates), we have the condition `x + y >= 0`. This makes sense because in the first iteration (`x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()` and `y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()`) both variables are non-negative, so their sum is also non-negative. Then, as long as the loop continues to execute (i.e., while `__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()` returns 1), we have that in each iteration `x` becomes equal to `y`, which was previously equal to `x + y`. Therefore, at any point during or after the execution of this loop, `0 <= x + y`.

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= x + y ;
benchmark12_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant t <= y;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, it must be true that `t` is less than or equal to `y`. This property holds throughout the entire execution of the while loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : t <= y;
benchmark31_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant x + y >= 0;

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration and remains true throughout. At the start of the first iteration, `x` can be negative or non-negative (since it's a nondeterministic integer), but since `y` is initialized to zero, `x+y>=0`. In subsequent iterations, if `x<0`, then `x+x+y >= 0` because we increment both `x` and `y`; otherwise, the loop terminates when `x>=0`.

//@ loop invariant mask : x + y ;
array-1.c
The loop invariant is that for all iterations of the loop, `array[k] >= menor` holds true for any index `k` such that `0 <= k < j`.

This means that at the beginning and end of each iteration, we know that all elements in the array up to the current index are greater than or equal to the smallest element found so far.

Here is the loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant forall k; 0<=k<j ==> array[k] >= menor;

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
matrix-1.c
The loop invariant is: 

For all iterations of the inner loop, `matiz[i][j] <= maior` for `i=0,...,N_COL-1`, and `j=0,...,k`. This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, each element in the matrix up to row `k` is less than or equal to the current maximum value.

//@ loop invariant mask : \forall i,j. 0 <= i < N_COL && 0 <= j <= k --> matriz[i][j] <= maior;
terminator_01.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `*p` is equal to the original value of `x` plus one for each iteration.

Here's how you can compute it:

Initially, before entering the while loop, we have `x=__VERIFIER_nondet_int();`, which means `x` could be any integer. We also initialize `p = &x;`. So at this point, `(p)` is equal to `x`.

Now let's analyze what happens inside the loop:

- The condition of the while loop checks if `x < 100`.
- If it is true, then we increment `(p)++`, which means that `(p)` becomes one more than its previous value.
- This process continues until `x` reaches or exceeds 100.

So at each iteration, `(p)` increases by one. Since the loop starts with `(p)` equal to `x`, after all iterations of the while loop, `(p)` will be equal to `x + (number_of_iterations)`. 

Since we know that `x < 100` initially and increment it until it reaches or exceeds 100, the number of iterations is at most 99. Therefore, `(p)` can take on any value from `1` to `100`.

So our loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : *p == x + (0..99);
in-de20.c
The loop invariant for the first annotated loop is:

x == n - i, where i is the number of iterations.

This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, the value of `x` will be equal to the original value of `n`, minus the number of times the loop has iterated.
mono-crafted_1.c
The loop invariant is that the difference between y and z remains constant throughout the execution of both loops. This can be expressed as:

x + (y - z) = initial_value_of_x + (initial_value_of_y - initial_value_of_z)

Since x, y, and z are all initialized to 0 at the beginning of main(), we have that:

x + (y - z) = 0

This invariant remains true throughout both loops because in each iteration of the first loop, either x or y is incremented by 1. In the second loop, both x and y are decremented by 1.

So, our final answer would be:
//@ loop invariant mask : x + (y - z) == 0;
sumt9.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant i + j + k + v1 + v2 + v3 + v4 + v5 + v6 <= l;

This invariant states that the sum of all variables updated in the loop (i, j, k) and those incremented conditionally based on the remainder of `l` divided by certain numbers (`v1`, ..., `v6`) is always less than or equal to the current value of `l`.
vnew1.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:

//@ loop invariant k >= i / 3;

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true throughout. The value `k` starts as equal to `n`, then decreases by 1 in every iteration, while `i` increases by 3 in every iteration. Therefore, it's always true that `k >= i / 3`.

array_1-1.c
int main(void) {
  int A[2048];
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {
    //@ assert \valid(A + i);
    //@ assert i >= 0 && i <= 1023;
    A[i] = i;
  }

//@ loop invariant mask : \valid(A + i) && i >= 0 && i <= 1023;
}
array3.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to find a property that is true before entering the loop and remains true throughout each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop iterates until it finds an element in A equal to 0. We can use this fact to create our invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : i <= N && \forall int j; 0 <= j < i => A[j] != 0 ;

This invariant states that the index `i` is less than or equal to N (the length of array A), and all elements in A before position `i` are not equal to zero. This holds true before entering the loop, as we initialize `A` with non-zero values using __VERIFIER_nondet_int(). It also remains true throughout each iteration because if an element is found that equals 0, the loop exits and `i` becomes greater than N (which breaks the invariant). If no such element is found before reaching index N, then the loop terminates with `i == N`, which satisfies our invariant.

even.c
In this code, the loop invariant is that the value of 'x' is always even. This is because in each iteration of the while-loop, 'x' gets incremented by 2 which ensures that it remains an even number. Therefore, we can express this as:

terminator_01.c
In this code, the loop invariant should be:

//@ loop invariant \valid(p);
//@ loop invariant *p >= x && *p <= 101;
//@ loop invariant x < 100;

Explanation of the computed invariant:
- The first part of the invariant, //@ loop invariant \valid(p), ensures that the pointer p is always valid and points to a memory location where an integer can be stored. This condition remains true throughout the execution of the loop.
- The second part of the invariant, //@ loop invariant *p >= x && *p <= 101, states that the value pointed by p (which represents the variable 'x') is always greater than or equal to its initial value and less than or equal to 101. This condition holds because inside the loop, we are incrementing the value of x, so it should never exceed 101.
- The third part of the invariant, //@ loop invariant x < 100, ensures that the termination condition for the while loop is maintained throughout the execution of the loop. Since the loop continues until 'x' becomes greater than or equal to 100, this invariant guarantees that it will eventually terminate.

The loop invariant is that the value of A[1023] is not equal to 1023.
array3.c
The loop invariant is that the value of A[i] is not equal to 0 for all i in the range 0 to N-1.
diamond_2-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of x will be equal to 99 at the end of the loop.
underapprox_1-1.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the value of x is less than or equal to 6.
even.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the value of x is not divisible by 2.
```vbnet
int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 0;
  while (__VERIFIER_nondet_int()) {
    x += 2;
  }
//@ assert !(x % 2);
  return 0;
}
```
linear-inequality-inv-a.c
Here is the loop invariant for the annotated loop in the given C code:
```
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = __VERIFIER_nondet_uchar();
```
The loop invariant is that the variable `X` is initialized to `__VERIFIER_nondet_uchar()`, which means that it has not been assigned a value yet. This ensures that the loop will execute at least once before any other statements are executed.
deep-nested.c
The loop invariant is that the loop will not execute if any of the conditions in the loop are true. The loop will only execute if all of the conditions in the loop are false. This can be achieved by adding a boolean variable to keep track of whether any of the conditions in the loop are true, and using this variable as a loop invariant.

Here is an example of how this can be implemented:
```
int main() {
    bool loop_invariant = false;
    for (unsigned i = 0; i < uint32_max; ++i) {
        if (loop_invariant) {
            break;
        }
        // do something
    }
    return 0;
}
```
In this example, the loop invariant is a boolean variable called `loop_invariant`. The loop will only execute if `loop_invariant` is false. If any of the conditions in the loop are true, the loop will break and the program will not execute further.

            reach_error();

The loop invariant is that the value of `y` is greater than or equal to the sum of `x` and `t`. This can be expressed using the following ACSL annotations:

    int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
    int t = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();

    }
//@ assert y>=t;
}
```

    while (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()) {
        if(x>0) y=y+x;
    }
//@ assert y>=t;
}
```
benchmark31_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the value of x remains within the range of -1 and 1. This can be proven by observing that if x is negative, it will eventually become positive again due to the addition of y. Therefore, the loop will continue until x reaches 0, at which point the loop will terminate and the program will return 0.
array-1.c
The loop invariant is:

loop invariant array[j] <= menor for all j in SIZE (1)

This means that the value of the array at each iteration of the loop is less than or equal to the current minimum value in the array.

array_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and compare it with the final value of the variable after the loop ends. The loop iterates over i from 0 to 999 (inclusive) and assigns each iteration A[i] = i. After the loop, A is an array containing consecutive integers from 0 to 1023.

The final value of A[1023] after the loop is unknown because it depends on how many iterations were performed by the outer loop (which can be any number between 0 and 999). Therefore, we cannot guarantee that A[1023] will not equal 1023.

However, if we assume that no more than 1024 iterations are executed in the inner loop, then it is possible to compute a loop invariant for this case. In this scenario, after each iteration of the outer loop, A[i] would be unique and not equal to any other element in A (since i ranges from 0 to 999). Therefore, we can say that:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

where X is the computed invariant.
array3.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the value of X. In this case, let's consider A[i] as our variable of interest and assume it is modified only by the for loop. Then, we can write the following loop invariant mask:

//@ loop invariant mask : A[i];

This means that at any iteration i, A[i] will have a value either generated by __VERIFIER_nondet_int() or equal to 0.
diamond_2-2.c
The loop invariant for the given code is X = y modulo 2. This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, x will have the same remainder when divided by 2 as y does when divided by 2.
underapprox_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables involved in the loop. The loop iterates until x reaches 6, and during each iteration, both x and y are incremented. However, only x is updated by the condition (x < 6), while y's value depends solely on its multiplication with 2. Therefore, we can show that after any iteration of the loop, the product y will always be less than or equal to 128, which means it cannot be equal to 64. Thus, the invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = x + (y <= 128);
even.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the while loop. The only statement executed in this loop is x += 2. This means that the value of x will increase by 2 each time the loop runs. Since x is an unsigned integer type, it can take any positive value. Therefore, after each iteration of the loop, x will be odd (x % 2 != 0).

The invariant we want to prove is that at the end of every iteration of the loop, x is odd. To express this in ACSL notation, we can use the following formula:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

where X is the computed invariant. In this case, X = (x % 2) != 0.
linear-inequality-inv-a.c
//@ loop invariant mask : X ; // where X is the computed invariant.

  unsigned int i = 0;
  while (i < n) {
    v = __VERIFIER_nondet_uchar(); // choose a random value for v

    ++i; // increment the counter
  }
  if (s >= v) {
    reach_error();
    return 1; // this condition is always false, since s < v by definition of while loop

    reach_error();
    return 1;

  return 0;

benchmark01_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and the statements inside the loop. The loop is entered when a boolean value is nondeterministic (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()), which means that it can be either true or false at any given time.

The loop body consists of two assignments: x = x + y and y = x. These statements do not preserve the invariant, as they change the values of x and y in each iteration. Therefore, we cannot compute a valid loop invariant for this loop. The loop condition is also nondeterministic, which means that it can be either true or false at any given time, depending on the value returned by __VERIFIER_nondet_int().

Since there is no way to determine if the loop will ever terminate or not based on its current state and condition, we cannot compute a valid loop invariant for this code. Therefore, the answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
benchmark12_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and the body of the while loop. The condition is based on a boolean value returned by an unpredictable source (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()), which makes it impossible to determine its value at compile time. Therefore, any loop invariant that depends on this condition cannot be computed.

However, we can still compute an invariant for the body of the while loop, since it only involves arithmetic operations and assignments. In this case, the invariant is simply y >= t, which means that after each iteration of the loop, y will always be greater or equal to t. This is true because if x > 0 in the first iteration, then y = y + x; otherwise, y remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
final answer for X : y >= t ;
benchmark31_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop and its body. The while loop runs indefinitely until x is greater than or equal to zero. The body of the loop updates the values of x and y using assignment and increment operations. Here is the loop invariant mask:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x >= 0) * (y > 0); // This expression ensures that as long as x is not negative, both x and y are positive or zero
array-1.c
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (array[0] >= menor);
matrix-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to check if the condition is true after each iteration of the outer loop. In this case, we want to verify that matriz[0][0] <= maior, which means that the first element of the matrix and its corresponding row are less than or equal to the largest value found in the inner loop.

Here is a possible loop invariant for the annotated loop:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires matriz[j][k] <= maior for all j and k ;
//@ ensures matriz[0][0] <= maior ;

The invariant starts with requiring that each element of the matrix is less than or equal to the largest value found in the inner loop, which is garantido by the if statement. Then it asserts that the first row and column of the matrix are also less than or equal to the largest value, which is equivalent to matriz[0][0] <= maior.

The invariant can be written in a more concise way using the ACSL keyword requires instead of garantido:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires matriz[j][k] <= maior for all j and k ;
//@ ensures matriz[0][0] <= maior ;
terminator_01.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and how it affects the value of X. The loop iterates while x is less than 100, and in each iteration, p points to an incremented value stored at x. Therefore, the loop invariant should capture that the value pointed by p does not change during the loop body.

The following ACSL annotation computes such a loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = &x; // store the address of x in X
while (x < 100) {
  int temp = *p; // save the value pointed by p before incrementing it
  (*p)++; // increment p inside the loop body
  if (temp == *p) { // check if the value pointed by p is unchanged after the increment
    // do nothing, since the invariant holds true in this case
  } else {
    // update X with a new address that corresponds to the old value of p before the increment
    X = temp;
  }
}
//@ end loop ;
in-de20.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to consider the values of variables inside and outside the loop. The loop variable is x, which decrements by one in each iteration. The other variables are n (the number of iterations), y (which increases by one in each iteration) and z (which is assigned the value of y after the first while loop).

We can observe that at the beginning of the loop, x = n, y = 0 and z = 0. After each iteration, these values change as follows:
- Incrementing x by one
- Decrementing x by one in the second while loop (which does not affect the value of x)
- Incrementing y by one
- Assigning z the value of y after the first while loop

Therefore, we can conclude that at the end of the loop, x = n - 1, y = 2 * n and z = 2 * n. This means that for any value of n, these values will satisfy this relationship:
x <= n; // x is always less than or equal to n (the number of iterations)
y >= 0; // y is always non-negative
z >= 0; // z is always non-negative

Based on this analysis, we can define the loop invariant as follows:
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X = x <= n. This means that at any point in the loop, the value of x will be less than or equal to the number of iterations (n).
mono-crafted_1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and body of each loop. Let's start with the first while loop:

- The initial value of x is 0.
- The condition checks if x < 1000000. If yes, then it increments x by 1. Otherwise, it increments both x and y by 1.
- After each iteration, the values of x and y are updated according to the body of the loop.

Now let's analyze the second while loop:

- The condition checks if y > z. If yes, then it decrements y by 1. This updates the value of z as well since they share a common variable (y).
- After each iteration, the values of x and z are updated according to the body of the loop.

Now let's combine our findings:

- The invariant for the first while loop is that x >= 50000 after every iteration. This is because if the condition is true (x < 1000000), then it increments both x and y, which means x must be greater than or equal to 50000 in each iteration.
- The invariant for the second while loop is that z >= y after every iteration. This is because if the condition is true (y > z), then it decrements y by 1, which updates the value of z as well and ensures that z must be greater than or equal to y in each iteration.
- Therefore, we can combine these two invariants using the logical AND operator: x >= 50000 && z >= y. This means that after every iteration of both loops, x is at least 50000 and z is at least y.

Hence, our loop invariant for this C code is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

###Answer: //@ loop invariant mask : X ; where X = (x >= 50000) && (z >=y);
sumt9.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find an expression that is always true within each iteration of the loop. We can observe that in every iteration, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5 and v6 are incremented by 1 if their corresponding condition is met (% operator). Also, i and j are incremented by 1 when the condition %2 is met. Finally, l is always incremented by 1 at each iteration of the loop. Therefore, a possible invariant for this loop could be:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = v6 + v5 + v4 + v3 + v2 + v1 + i + j + k + l;

This expression ensures that the sum of all variables and the additional values from incrementing i, j, k, and l will always equal to l in each iteration.
vnew1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to examine the state of the variables before and after each iteration. The loop invariant should be true for all iterations of the loop except possibly the first one. We can use the following steps to find the loop invariant:

- Identify the initial value of each variable in the loop. In this case, i is initialized to 0, k is initialized to n, and j is not initialized but we assume it starts at 0.
- For each iteration of the loop, compare the final value of each variable with its initial value. If no change occurs, then the invariant holds true for that iteration. Otherwise, if there is a change in any variable, then the invariant does not hold true for that iteration.
- Write the loop invariant as a logical expression using the variables and their final values. Use ACSL annotations to indicate the invariant.

Following these steps, we can write the following loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = k > 0; // The loop invariant holds true if k is positive after each iteration of the loop except possibly the first one.
