benchmark04_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

k + j <= n;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after all iterations have been performed (i.e., when j == n), we know that the sum of k and j will not exceed n.

//@ loop invariant mask : k+j<=n;

=========================================

benchmark05_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 0 <= x && x <= n && y >= x;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every execution of the body (i.e., incrementing `x` and possibly `y`), we know that `x` is between 0 and `n`, inclusive, and `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= x && x <= n && y >= x;

=========================================

benchmark29_linear.c
The loop invariant for this annotated loop is:

// @loop invariant true : x == y - ((y-x)/100)*100;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after the last iteration (i.e., when the loop terminates), the value of `x` will be equal to `y` minus some multiple of 100. This is because in each iteration, we increment `x` by a constant amount (`+100`) until it reaches or exceeds `y`.

=========================================

benchmark25_linear.c
A classic example!

The loop invariant is: `@loop invariant 0 <= x < 11;`

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the loop finishes (i.e., when `x >= 10`), the following condition holds:

* `x` is always greater than or equal to 0 (`0 <= x`)
* `x` is less than 11 (`< 11`)

This invariant captures the fact that the value of `x` increases monotonically during each iteration, and eventually reaches (but does not exceed) 10.

So, the final answer is:
//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= x < 11;

=========================================

benchmark37_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 0 <= i : Int ; 
where `i` represents the current value of either `x` or `y`. This invariant holds at the beginning and end of each iteration, as well as before entering the loop. The assertion `y >= 0;` can be proved by considering that when the loop terminates (when `x <= 0`), we know from the invariant that both `x` and `y` are non-negative.

So, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= i ;

=========================================

benchmark36_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant i : (x - i) * (y - i) <= 0;

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration, and it remains true throughout the entire execution. The variable `i` represents the current value of `x`, which is incremented by one in each iteration.

The reason for this choice is that initially `x == y && y == 0`. In each subsequent iteration, both `x` and `y` are incremented by one until they become equal again. This invariant captures the relationship between `x` and `y` at any given point during the execution of the loop.

The final assertion in the code is a consequence of this invariant: when the loop terminates, we know that `(x - i) * (y - i)` will be zero for some value of `i`, which means `x == y`.

=========================================

benchmark24_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant true : 2 * k >= n - 1;

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration and after the last iteration. It states that the product of 2 and k is always greater than or equal to one less than n.

Note: The ACSL annotation format requires a boolean expression as the first argument, which in this case can be simply `true` since we're not asserting anything specific about the loop's behavior beyond what's already established.

=========================================

benchmark25_linear_abstracted.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 0 <= x && x <= 10;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the last iteration (i.e., when the loop terminates), the value of `x` satisfies this condition. The initial condition holds because we set `x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()` before entering the loop, which can be any integer including those within the range [0, 10]. 

The maintenance conditions hold for each iteration: if `x < (10)`, then `x=x+1` will make `x <= (10)`; and if `(x >= 10)`, we exit the loop. The termination condition holds because when `x = (10)`, we also exit the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= x && x <= 10 ;

=========================================

benchmark03_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant i <= j;

This invariant holds because initially `i` and `j` are both zero, so the inequality is trivially true. In each iteration of the loop, `i` increases by `x`, while `j` increases by `y`. Since `flag` can be either `true` or `false`, we cannot determine whether `x >= y` or not. However, since `i <= j` initially and both are non-decreasing in each iteration of the loop, it remains true throughout the execution.

//@ loop invariant mask : i <= j;

=========================================

benchmark51_polynomial.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant true : x >= 0 && x <= 50;

This invariant states that the condition `x >= 0` and `x <= 50` holds at every iteration of the while loop. This can be proved by analyzing the code: 

- The initial value of `x` satisfies this condition.
- In each iteration, either `x++`, or `x--`, is executed based on whether `x > 50` or not. These operations do not change the sign of `x`.
- If `x == 0`, then it increments to `1`. This also does not affect the sign of `x`.

Therefore, at every iteration, we can be sure that `x >= 0 && x <= 50`.

=========================================

benchmark01_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 0 <= x + y ; 
This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every execution of the body (x = x+y; y = x), the sum of x and y will always be greater than or equal to zero.

=========================================

benchmark45_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant mask : x >= 0 && y >= 0;

This means that at the beginning and end of each iteration, both `x` and `y` are greater than or equal to zero. This property holds throughout the execution of the loop.

Note that this invariant does not necessarily imply anything about whether either `x` or `y` is positive; it only ensures they are non-negative.

=========================================

benchmark13_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant true : i == j;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the loop finishes (since it's a postcondition), we have `j` equal to `i`. This makes sense because in each iteration, both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1.

=========================================

benchmark33_linear.c
The loop invariant for this code is:

//@ loop invariant 0 <= i : x ; 

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the loop finishes (i.e., when `x >= 100`), we know that `0 <= x`. This property holds throughout the execution of the program.

=========================================

benchmark44_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

 //@ loop invariant 0 <= (x - y) % 17 < 7;

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and after the loop terminates. The condition `(x - y) % 17` remains within a certain range, specifically between `0` and `6`.

=========================================

benchmark16_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

i == 1 + j and k == 2 - j, where j is the number of iterations performed so far.

This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, we can be sure that i equals one more than the total number of iterations minus k (which has been decremented by each iteration), and k equals two minus this same quantity. This invariant holds true for all values of j from 0 to n-1.

//@ loop invariant mask : i == 1 + j && k == 2 - j;

=========================================

benchmark39_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

 //@ loop invariant x == 4*y || x < 4;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, either `x` equals `4*y`, or it's less than `4`. This property holds throughout the entire execution of the while-loop. The reason for this is as follows:

- Initially, before entering the loop, we know that `x == 4*y && x >= 0`.
- In each iteration, if `x` equals `4*y`, then it will continue to do so after subtracting `4` from `x`. This is because `y--` does not affect this condition.
- If initially `x < 4*y`, then in the first iteration of the loop, we have `x -= 4; y--;`. Since `x >= 0`, it must be that `x < 4*y` still holds. In subsequent iterations, as long as `x > 0`, this condition will continue to hold.

So, either `x == 4*y` or `x < 4` at the start of each iteration. This is our invariant.

//@ loop invariant mask : x == 4*y || x < 4;

=========================================

benchmark27_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

k >= j - i;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, we know that `k` is greater than or equal to the difference between `j` and `i`.

//@ loop invariant mask : k >= (int)j - (int)i;

=========================================

benchmark15_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

low <= mid && mid <= high;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the last iteration (i.e., when `mid` becomes zero), we have a guarantee that `low` will always be less than or equal to `mid`, which in turn will always be less than or equal to `high`.

//@ loop invariant mask : low <= mid && mid <= high;

=========================================

benchmark38_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

x - 4*(y-1) >= 0;

This means that the difference between `x` and four times `(y-1)` will always be non-negative at each iteration of the while loop. This can be proven by considering what happens in one iteration:

* `x` increases by 4, so it becomes `x+4`.
* `y` increments by 1.
The invariant is preserved because we are adding a multiple of 4 to `x`, and subtracting 1 from `(y-1)`. This does not change the value of `x - 4*(y-1)`.

So, at each iteration, this expression will always be non-negative. 

//@ loop invariant mask : x - 4*(y-1) >= 0;

=========================================

benchmark46_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant mask : x >= 0 && (y > 0 || z > 0) ;

=========================================

benchmark19_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant k <= j ; 

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and immediately before the loop terminates, we have k <= j. This makes sense because in each iteration, both j and k are decremented by one, so their difference remains non-negative.

//@ loop invariant mask : k <= j;

=========================================

benchmark48_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

k >= i + 1;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after all iterations have been performed, we can be sure that `k` will always be greater than or equal to `i+1`.

//@ loop invariant mask : k >= i + 1;

=========================================

benchmark50_linear.c
The loop invariant is: 

 //@ loop invariant mask : ya <= xa;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the loop finishes (since it's a postcondition), `ya` will always be less than or equal to `xa`. This property holds because in each iteration, we decrement `xa` by 1 and increment `ya` by 1.

=========================================

benchmark08_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

sum == n * ((n-1)/2 + 1)

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the last iteration (i.e., when i==n), this equation holds.

//@ loop invariant mask : sum == n * ((n-1)/2 + 1);

=========================================

benchmark49_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

`@loop invariant i <= j && i >= 0;`

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, `i` will be less than or equal to `j`, and also greater than or equal to zero.

//@ loop invariant mask : i <= j && i >= 0;

=========================================

benchmark52_polynomial.c
The loop invariant is that the absolute value of `i` remains less than or equal to 10.

Here's how you can compute it:

Initially, we know that `i` satisfies `-10 < i < 10`. This is because if this condition were not satisfied, the program would have returned immediately. 

Now consider what happens in each iteration of the loop: 
- The value of `i` increases by 1.
- Since `i * i < 100`, we know that either `i > -10` or `i < 10`. If it were not true, then `(i+1) * (i+1)` would be greater than or equal to 100.

Therefore, after each iteration of the loop, `-10 <= i <= 10`.

So, our invariant is: 
//@ loop invariant mask : -10 <= |i| <= 10;

=========================================

benchmark30_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 0 <= i && i <= j;

where `i` and `j` are the values of `x` and `y`, respectively. This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration, as well as after the loop finishes.

This invariant ensures that we always have a valid relationship between `x` and `y`.

=========================================

benchmark06_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

j <= i && (x + y == k)

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true throughout. The condition `j <= i` ensures that the while loop continues as long as `i` has not been reached yet, which in turn guarantees that the sum `x+y` stays equal to `k`.

//@ loop invariant mask : j <= i && (x + y == k) ;

=========================================

benchmark28_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant 0 <= i && i <= j;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every execution of the body of the loop, we have `i` less than or equal to `j`.

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= i && i <= j;

=========================================

benchmark40_polynomial.c
The loop invariant is that the product of `x` and `y` remains non-negative throughout the execution of the loop. This can be formally stated as:

 //@ loop invariant mask : (x * y >= 0);

=========================================

benchmark41_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

x - y + z == 0;

This means that the sum of x, y and z remains constant throughout the execution of the while loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : x - y + z ;

=========================================

benchmark34_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

`@loop invariant k >= 0;`

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and after the last iteration. At the start, `j < n` and `n > 0`, so `k == n`. Then in each iteration, we increment `j` and decrement `k`, which maintains this condition.

//@ loop invariant mask : k >= 0;

=========================================

benchmark47_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

x - y >= -7 && x - y <= 6;

This can be computed by observing that in each iteration of the while loop, either x or y (or both) may change. If x < 0, then it will increase by 7; if x ≥ 0, then it will increase by 10. Similarly, if y < 0, then it will decrease by 10; if y ≥ 0, then it will increase by 3.

The key observation is that the difference between x and y can only change by a constant amount in each iteration of the loop (either +7 or -10). Therefore, we can write an invariant that describes this relationship:

x - y >= min(-y, -16) && x - y <= max(y, 6)

This expression is equivalent to the one given above.

//@ loop invariant mask : x - y >= -7 && x - y <= 6;

=========================================

benchmark43_conjunctive_abstracted.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant true;

This means that the condition `true` holds at the beginning of each iteration and remains unchanged throughout the entire execution of the loop. This is because there are no assignments to any variables inside the loop, so their values remain constant.

However, if you want a more meaningful invariant related to the conditions in the code, it could be:

//@ loop invariant (x >= 100 || y >= 100);

This means that after each iteration of the loop, either `x` or `y`, or both, must have reached at least 100. This is because if neither condition was met initially, then the loop would terminate immediately due to the abort() function call.

//@ loop invariant mask : (x >= 100 || y >= 100);

=========================================

benchmark12_linear.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant t <= x + (y - t); 

This invariant holds because the condition in the while loop ensures that as long as `x` is greater than zero, `y` will be updated to be at least `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop. Therefore, we can conclude that `t <= x + (y - t)` always holds.

//@ loop invariant mask : y >= t;

=========================================

benchmark22_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

 //@ loop invariant x - y <= mask ; 
where `mask` is the computed invariant. This means that at any point during the execution of the while loop, the difference between `x` and `y` will be less than or equal to the initial value of this expression.

This invariant holds because in each iteration of the loop, we increment `y` by 1 and add `y` to `x`, so their difference remains unchanged.

=========================================

benchmark35_linear.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

//@ loop invariant 0 <= i : x ; 

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and immediately before the loop body executes, it holds true that `x` is greater than or equal to 0. This condition remains unchanged throughout all iterations of the while-loop.

The reason for this choice is as follows: The initial value of `x` can be any non-negative integer (since we have a check at the beginning of the function), and then in each iteration, `x` gets incremented by 1 until it reaches or exceeds 10. Therefore, after all iterations are completed (`x >= 0 && x < 10` becomes false), we know that `x` must be greater than or equal to 10.

So, this invariant captures the essential property of the loop: at each iteration and before entering the body of the while-loop, it is true that `x` has not yet reached a value less than 0.

=========================================

benchmark17_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

`@loop invariant i <= n;`

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, `i` will always be less than or equal to `n`, and this property holds throughout the entire execution of the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : i <= n ;

=========================================

benchmark10_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant i >= 0 && c == i * (c / i);

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true throughout. The condition `i >= 0` ensures that we never access memory outside the bounds of an array, which would be a runtime error in C.

=========================================

benchmark23_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

j == 2*i - 2;

This can be proven by observing that the value of `j` at the beginning of each iteration is equal to twice the current value of `i`, minus 2. This relationship holds throughout the entire execution of the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : j==2*i-2;

=========================================

benchmark43_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant true;

This means that the condition `x == 100 || y == 100` holds at the beginning of each iteration, and it also holds after the last iteration. This is because in each iteration, either x or y (or both) increases by 1 until one of them reaches 100.

//@ loop invariant mask : true;

=========================================

benchmark14_linear.c
The loop invariant is: `@loop invariant true : i >= 0;`

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and also after the loop finishes (i.e., when `i` becomes 0), we know that `i` will always be greater than or equal to 0.

//@ loop invariant mask : i >= 0;

=========================================

benchmark26_linear.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant y >= x;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, we know that `y` will always be greater than or equal to `x`. This property holds throughout the entire execution of the while loop.

So, our final answer would be:

int main() { 
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(); 
  int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(); 
  if (!(x<y)) return 0; 
  while (x<y) { 
    x=x+1;
   }
//@ assert x==y; 
  return 0; 
} 
//@ loop invariant mask : y >= x ;

=========================================

benchmark02_linear.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `i` and `l` are equal at each iteration.

So, the computed invariant would be:

//@ loop invariant mask : i == l ;

=========================================

benchmark31_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

 //@ loop invariant true : y >= 0;

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration and remains unchanged throughout. The condition `y >= 0` is maintained because in each iteration, either `x` becomes non-negative (in which case the loop terminates) or `y` increases by 1 while `x` decreases by `y`, ensuring that `y` always stays non-negative.

//@ loop invariant mask : y >= 0;

=========================================

benchmark09_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

 //@ loop invariant true : X;

This means that the condition `true` holds at the beginning of each iteration, and it remains unchanged throughout the iterations. In other words, there's no specific property about x or y that we can deduce from one iteration to another.

However, if you want a more meaningful invariant, notice that in this code, both `x` and `y` are decremented by 1 at each iteration until either of them becomes less than 0. Therefore, the loop invariant could be:

 //@ loop invariant (x >= y) && (x > 0) : X;

This means that throughout all iterations, it's always true that `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and also that both are positive.

=========================================

benchmark26_linear_abstracted.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant x <= y;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, we know that `x` will be less than or equal to `y`. This condition holds throughout the entire execution of the annotated code.

=========================================

benchmark11_linear_abstracted.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant 0 <= x && x <= n;

This invariant holds true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true after each iteration. The condition `x < n` in the if statements ensures that `x` never exceeds `n`, so we can conclude that `0 <= x && x <= n`.

=========================================

benchmark18_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that `i` and `k` are always equal, as well as the fact that their sum (`n`) has not changed.

So, the computed invariant would be:

//@ loop invariant i==k ;

=========================================

benchmark32_linear.c
The loop invariant is that the absolute difference between `x` and either of its possible values, 1 or 2, remains constant throughout the execution of the loop.

So, we can write this as:

```
int main() {
    // ...
    while (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()) { 
        if(x==1) x=2;
        else if (x==2) x=1; 
    } 
//@ assert |x-1| == |y-1|;
}
//@ loop invariant mask : |x-1| ; 
```

In this code, `y` is the initial value of `x`, which could be either 1 or 2. The absolute difference between `x` and its possible values remains constant throughout the execution of the loop.

The final assertion that `x <= 8` can also be expressed in terms of our invariant:

```
//@ assert |y-1| + 3 >= x;
```

=========================================

benchmark21_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : x >= -y && ((x > 0) == (y <= 0));

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration, and it remains true after each iteration. The condition `x >= -y` ensures that if `x` has increased by one in an iteration, then `-y` must have decreased by one or more to keep this inequality valid.

=========================================

benchmark20_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

sum == ∑[k=0 to i-1] k;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, the variable `sum` holds the sum of all integers from 0 up to and including the current value of `i`.

//@ loop invariant mask : sum == ∑[k=0 to i-1] k;

=========================================

benchmark02_linear_abstracted.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant i <= n;

This invariant holds because initially, `i` and `n` are both nondeterministically chosen. In the first iteration of the loop (if it's executed at all), `i` might be less than or equal to `n`. If the condition in the if-statement is true, then `i` will be set to a new value which could still be less than or equal to `n`. The invariant holds throughout the entire execution of the loop.

=========================================

benchmark42_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant x + y - z == __VERIFIER_nondet_int() - (i+1); 
where i is the number of iterations in the while loop.

This invariant holds at the beginning and end of each iteration, as well as after the loop finishes. It can be proven by induction on the number of iterations.

//@ loop invariant mask : x + y - z == __VERIFIER_nondet_int() - (i+1);

=========================================

benchmark11_linear.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

// @loop invariant true : x <= n;

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration and after the last iteration. At the start of the first iteration, it's trivially true because `x` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

In subsequent iterations, if we assume that the loop invariant was true before entering the current iteration (i.e., at the beginning of this iteration), then:

- If `x < n`, then incrementing `x` will still satisfy the condition `x <= n`.
- If `x == n`, then the loop terminates and the assertion is satisfied.

Therefore, we can conclude that the invariant holds for all iterations.

=========================================

benchmark53_polynomial.c
The loop invariant is: 

x * |y| == x * y

This means that the product of `x` and the absolute value of `y` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

 //@ loop invariant mask : (x * abs(y) == x * y);

=========================================

benchmark07_linear.c
The loop invariant is:

// @loop invariant i <= n;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

And here's the final annotation:

=========================================

benchmark25_linear.c
In this code, the loop invariant is quite simple. The variable `x` starts at a value determined by `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, which can be any integer except negative numbers (due to the if statement). However, since we are only interested in the while loop, let's focus on that part of the code:
```c
while (x<10) {
  x=x+1;
}

The invariant for this loop is simply `x == 10`. This means that at each iteration of the loop, `x` must be equal to 10. Since we increment `x` by one in every iteration and our initial value of `x` is not negative (due to if statement), it follows that after all iterations, `x` will indeed be equal to 10.

The loop invariant for the given code is:
//@ loop invariant  mask : x == y && x >= 0 ;
This means that before each iteration of the while loop, `x` and `y` are equal and both greater than or equal to zero. The loop decrements `x` and `y`, so at the end of the loop execution, `y` will be non-negative as required by the assertion statement.

To compute a loop invariant for the given annotated loop, we need to analyze the code and find a property that is true before each iteration of the loop and remains true throughout the execution. In this case, let's consider the following loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : 1 <= i + k && i + k <= 2 && i >= 1;

This invariant states that after every iteration of the while-loop, the sum of 'i' and 'k' will be between 1 and 2 (inclusive), and 'i' will always be greater than or equal to 1. This property holds initially (as stated in the assertion) and remains true throughout the loop execution due to the incrementation of 'i' and decrementation of 'k'.

benchmark46_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given annotated loop, we need to identify the properties that hold at each iteration of the while loop. Let's analyze the code:

1. The loop continues as long as __VERIFIER_nondet_bool() returns true. This means that there is no specific condition on the variables x, y, and z inside the loop body. However, we know from the if statement before the while loop that at least one of them must be positive (y>0 || x>0 || z>0).
2. Inside the loop, we have two conditional statements: 
   - If x > 0, then x is incremented by 1. This means that if x was initially greater than 0, it will remain so after each iteration of this condition. However, if x starts as 0 or becomes 0 during the execution, it won't be incremented and will stay at 0.
   - If y > 0, then y is incremented by 1. Similarly to x, if y was initially greater than 0, it will remain so after each iteration of this condition. But if y starts as 0 or becomes 0 during the execution, it won't be incremented and will stay at 0.
   - If y is not greater than 0 (i.e., y = 0), then z is incremented by 1. This means that if z was initially greater than 0, it will remain so after each iteration of this condition. However, if z starts as 0 or becomes 0 during the execution, it won't be incremented and will stay at 0.
3. The loop invariant should cover all possible cases for x, y, and z: when they are greater than 0 or equal to 0.

Considering these observations, we can compute a loop invariant as follows:
//@ loop invariant mask : (x >= 0) && (y >= 0) && (z >= 0);
This invariant states that at each iteration of the while loop, x, y, and z are all greater than or equal to 0. This covers all possible cases for these variables, ensuring that they maintain their initial conditions throughout the execution of the loop.

In this code, the loop is used to decrement `xa` and increment `ya` until `xa` becomes zero. The invariant should express that `xa` will eventually become zero and that `ya` will be greater than or equal to `xa`. Here's the computed invariant:
//@ loop invariant mask : (0 <= xa && ya >= xa);
This means that as long as `xa` is non-negative and `ya` is greater than or equal to `xa`, the loop invariant holds.

benchmark30_conjunctive.c
In this code, the loop increments both `x` and `y`, so we can establish an invariant that relates them. Since the loop continues until a boolean condition is false (which could be any value), it means that at some point in the future, the boolean will become false. Therefore, eventually, `x == y`.

//@ loop invariant mask : x == y;

=========================================

benchmark06_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given annotated loop, we need to analyze the code and find a property that is true before each iteration of the while loop and implies the postcondition. Let's break down the code:

1. We have five variables: `j`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `k`.
2. The initial values are set using non-deterministic functions, except for `j` which is initialized to 0.
3. There's an if statement that checks whether the sum of `x` and `y` equals `k`. If not, the function returns 0.
4. Inside a while loop with a non-deterministic boolean condition, there are two possible updates for `j`, `x`, and `y` based on their equality to `i`.
5. The loop continues until the non-deterministic boolean condition is false.
6. Finally, an assertion checks whether the sum of `x` and `y` equals `k`.

Now let's find a loop invariant:

Let M be the set containing all possible values for `j`, `i`, `x`, and `y` at any point in time during the execution of the program. We can define the following relation on M:
- If (m1, m2) is an element of R, then m1 represents the state before the while loop starts, and m2 represents a possible state after one iteration of the while loop.
- The first component of each pair in R corresponds to the initial state of the variables, i.e., `j=0`, `i` can be any value, `x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, and `y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()`.
- The second component of each pair in R corresponds to a state after one iteration of the while loop. In this case, `j` has been incremented by 1, and either `x` has been increased by 1 and `y` decreased by 1 (if `j == i`) or `y` has been increased by 1 and `x` decreased by 1 (otherwise).
- The relation R is transitive: if (m1, m2) and (m2, m3)

In this annotation:
- G is a boolean variable that represents the condition of the if statement in the loop. It will always be true inside the loop because it's checked before entering the loop and its value doesn't change during execution.
- H is a boolean variable representing the condition x > 0, which determines whether y gets updated or not.
- The first invariant states that when G is true (inside the if statement), then y >= t holds. This means that at each iteration of the loop where G is true, the value of y will be greater than or equal to t.
- The second invariant states that when ~G (outside the if statement), there exists an integer k such that y == t + k. This means that outside the if statement, the value of y can be any number between t and some higher value depending on how many times the loop has been executed.
- The third invariant relates to the case

The loop invariant for the given code is:

This invariant states that at any point during the execution of the while loop, the value of 'i' will be equal to 'n'. This holds true because in each iteration of the loop, 'i' and 'k' are incremented by one. Since we know that 'i' is initially less than 'n', it will continue to increase until it reaches 'n'. Once 'i' equals 'n', the while loop condition becomes false and the loop terminates.

The given code has a simple loop that counts down from the initial value of `i` to zero. Since there is no other operation performed on `i`, we can infer that the invariant for this loop should be simply the range of values that `i` can take within the loop. 
//@ loop invariant mask : i >= 0 && i <= 201;
This invariant states that at any point during the execution of the loop, the value of `i` will always lie between 0 and 201 (inclusive). This is because when we enter the loop, `i` can be in the range [1..200]. In each iteration, we decrement `i`, so it remains within this range until `i = 0`.

To compute a loop invariant for the given C code, we can start by identifying the properties that hold before and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop iterates until `x` is no longer less than `y`. Before each iteration, we have:
```c
int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
if (!(x<y)) return 0; // This assertion holds initially and after the loop exits.
while (x<y) {
```
And after each iteration, we have:
```c
  x=x+1;
}
//@ assert x==y;
```
The invariant should be a combination of these properties that holds before and after every iteration of the loop. In this case, the invariant is simply `(x == y) || (x < y && !(y - x <= 0))`. This invariant states that either `x` is equal to `y`, or `x` is less than `y` and there are no zeroes in the difference between `y` and `x`.

Now, we can add the [invariant] tag to our code:
```c
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x<y)) return 0;
  while (x<y) {
    x=x+1;
  }
//@ invariant mask : (x == y) || (x < y && !(y - x <= 0));
//@ assert x==y;
  return 0;
}
```

=========================================

benchmark02_linear.c
In this code, the loop is initialized with `int i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();` and then incremented until it reaches or exceeds `int n = __VERIFIF_nondet_int()`. Since we know that `l >= 1`, we can establish an invariant for this loop.

//@ loop invariant i >= l;
This invariant states that at each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is greater than or equal to the initial value of `l`. This ensures that the loop will continue until `i` reaches or exceeds `n`, as required by the code.

=========================================

benchmark02_linear_abstracted.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we first need to identify any loops in the code. However, there are no explicit loops present in this code snippet. Instead, it contains an if statement with two conditions that may act as a loop-like construct. We can rewrite this using a while loop to make it more apparent:
```c
int main() {
  int n = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int l = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  i = l;
  if (!(l>0)) return 0;
  
  while (i < n) {
    i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  }
//@ assert l>=1;
  return 0;
}
```
Now, let's compute a loop invariant for the while loop:
```c
while (i < n) {
  //@ loop invariant mask : i >= n || (l >= 1 && i == l);
  i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
}
```
Here, the computed invariant is `(i >= n || (l >= 1 && i == l))`. This means that either `i` is already greater than or equal to `n`, or if it's not yet true, then we know that `l` is at least 1 and `i` is currently set to the value of `l`.

  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int y = __VERIFIFICATOR_nondet_int();

  while (x > 0) {
    //@ invariant x > 0;
    //@ invariant y >= 0;
    //@ invariant z <= x + y;
    x--;
    y--;
    z++;
    z++;
  }
//@ loop invariant mask : x > 0 && y >= 0 && z <= x + y ;
}

=========================================

benchmark11_linear.c
In this code, the loop invariant is that `x` will eventually become equal to `n`. This can be expressed in ACSL as:
```c
/*@
  requires true;
  ensures x == n;
  assigns x, n;
*/
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int n = __VERIFIE_nondet_int();
  
  if (!(x==0 && n>0)) return 0;
  while (x < n) {
    x++;
  }
//@ loop invariant mask : x == n || x - 1 >= n;
}
```
The computed invariant is: `x == n || x - 1 >= n`. This means that either `x` is already equal to `n`, or the previous value of `x` was greater than or equal to `n`.

The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:
//@ loop invariant mask : x == 10 ;
where X is computed as follows:
The loop starts by checking if x < 10. If this condition is true, then it continues to execute the loop body until x becomes equal to or greater than 9 (since x cannot be equal to 10 yet). At each iteration of the loop, x is incremented by 1. Once x reaches 10, the loop terminates and the assertion x == 10 is checked to ensure that the loop has executed correctly. Therefore, the invariant X states that if the loop executes without any errors, then x will be equal to 10 after the loop terminates.

benchmark04_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:
```
loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (k >= 1 && k <= n-1 && j == 0);
```
This invariant ensures that the loop variable `j` starts at `n-1` and decrements by `k` until it reaches `0`, while the loop variable `k` starts at `1` and decrements by `n-1` until it reaches `0`. The loop variable `n` is not used in the loop invariant.

=========================================

benchmark05_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:
```
loop invariant mask : X ;
X = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
while (X < n) {
    X++;
    if (X > y) y++;
}
```
The loop invariant is:
```
X = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
while (X < n) {
    X++;
    if (X > y) y++;
}
```
This loop invariant ensures that the loop variable `X` starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches a maximum value of `n`. The loop also checks if `X` is less than or equal to `y` before incrementing `y`.

=========================================

benchmark29_linear.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the value of x is greater than or equal to the value of y. This can be expressed as follows:
```
int main() {
    int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
    int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
    if (!(x<y)) return 0;
    while (x<y) {
        x=x+100;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
The loop invariant mask is:
```
X: x>=y
```

=========================================

benchmark25_linear.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the value of x is less than or equal to 10.
```
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x<0)) return 0;
  while (x<10) {
    x=x+1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

=========================================

benchmark37_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the values of x and y are non-negative.

=========================================

benchmark36_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the values of x and y are always non-negative.

=========================================

benchmark24_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the variable `i` will be less than or equal to `n-1` at the end of the loop. This can be proven by induction on the loop counter `k`.

At the beginning of the loop, `i` is set to `__VERIFIER_nondet_int()`, which means that it has not been assigned a value yet. Then, `k` is decremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 2. This means that `i` will be less than or equal to `n-1` at the end of the loop.

The loop condition `while (i<n)` ensures that the loop will continue until `i` reaches `n`. The loop body `k--; i+=2;` updates `i` by incrementing it by 2 and decrementing `k` by 1. This means that `i` will be less than or equal to `n-1` at the end of the loop.

Therefore, the loop invariant is that `i` will be less than or equal to `n-1` at the end of the loop.

=========================================

benchmark25_linear_abstracted.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` will not be less than 10.

=========================================

benchmark03_linear.c
Here is the loop invariant for the annotated loop in the given C code:
```
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int j = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  
  _Bool flag = __VERIFIER_nondet_bool();
  x = 0; y = 0;
  if (!(i==0 && j==0)) return 0;
  while (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()) {
    x++;
    y++;
    i+=x;
    j+=y;
    if (flag) j+=1;
  }
//@ assert j>=i;
  return 0;
}
```
The loop invariant is that the values of `x`, `y`, and `j` are all non-negative at the beginning of the loop, and that `j` increases by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The loop also has a condition that checks if `j` is greater than or equal to `i`, which ensures that the loop continues until `j` reaches `i`.

=========================================

benchmark51_polynomial.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:
```
loop invariant mask : x >= 0 && x <= 50;
```
This means that the loop will run at least once and the value of `x` will be between 0 and 50.

  if (!(y>0 || x>0)) return 0;
  while (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()) {
    if (x>0) {
      x++;
    } else {
      y++;
    }
  }
//@ assert x>0 || y>0;
  return 0;
}
```

=========================================

benchmark13_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the value of j is always less than or equal to the value of i. This can be achieved by adding a condition in the while loop to check if j is less than i before incrementing it. The updated code would look like this:
```
int main() {
  int i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int j = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int k = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  
  if (!(i==0 && j==0)) return 0;
  while (i <= k) {
    i++;
    j=j+1;
  }
//@ assert j==i;
  return 0;
}
```

=========================================

benchmark33_linear.c
The loop invariant is that the value of x is always less than or equal to 100.

=========================================

benchmark44_disjunctive.c
Here is the loop invariant for the annotated loop in the C code:
```
int main() {
    int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
    int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
    if (!(x<y)) return 0;
    while (x<y) {
        if ((x<0 && y<0)) {
            x=x+7; y=y-10;
        }
        if ((x<0 && y>=0)) {
            x=x+7; y=y+3;
        } else {
            x=x+10; y=y+3;
        }
    }
}
```
The loop invariant is that the values of `x` and `y` are always within the range of -16 to 16, inclusive. This is achieved by checking if `x` is less than 0 and if `y` is greater than or equal to 0, and adjusting the value of `x` accordingly. If `x` is less than 0, it is incremented by 7, and if `y` is greater than or equal to 0, it is decremented by 3.

=========================================

benchmark16_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the value of `i` is always less than or equal to 2 and the value of `k` is always between 1 and 2.

=========================================

benchmark39_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is:
```
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x == 4*y && x >= 0)) return 0;
  while (x > 0) {
    x-=4;
    y--;

//@ assert y>=0;
  return 0;
}
```

=========================================

benchmark27_linear.c
The loop invariant is that the value of k is greater than or equal to the value of i at the end of the loop. This can be expressed as follows:
```
int main() {

  int j = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int k = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(i<j && k>i-j)) return 0;
  while (i<j) {
    k=k+1;
    i=i+1;
  }
//@ assert k > 0;
  return 0;
}
```

=========================================

benchmark15_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the loop will terminate when the value of `mid` becomes less than 1.

=========================================

benchmark38_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop in the given C code is:
```
x + y >= 0
```
This is because the loop condition is checking if `x` and `y` are both positive, and if they are, then the loop will continue. If either `x` or `y` becomes negative, the loop will terminate.

=========================================

benchmark46_disjunctive.c
The loop invariant for the given code is:
```
loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (y > 0 && x > 0) || (y > 0 && z > 0) || (x > 0 && z > 0);
```
The loop invariant is a boolean expression that evaluates to true at the end of the loop. The condition inside the parentheses is evaluated for each iteration of the loop, and if it is true, the loop continues. If any of the conditions are false, the loop terminates.

=========================================

benchmark19_conjunctive.c

```

benchmark22_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:

x >= y

This is because the loop condition is "while (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool())", which means that the loop will continue as long as the condition is true. The loop variable "x" is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and the loop variable "y" is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs. Since "x" is greater than "y", the loop will continue until "x" becomes equal to "y".

The loop invariant can be expressed using the ACSL annotations as follows:
```
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x==1 && y==0)) return 0;
  while (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()) {

The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the loop variable `i` is always less than or equal to the loop variable `n`. This can be proven by observing that the loop variable `i` starts at `l` and increments by 1 in each iteration, while the loop variable `n` starts at `0` and increases by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, if `n` is less than or equal to `l`, then `i` will be less than or equal to `n`.

The loop invariant for the annotated loop is:

X = (x == y && x >= 0 && x+y+z==0) && (y == z && y >= 0 && y+x+z==0) && (z == x && z >= 0 && z+y+x==0);
```
The loop invariant is a boolean expression that evaluates to true at the end of the loop. It consists of three conditions:

1. The loop variable `x` is equal to `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to zero.
2. The loop variable `y` is equal to `z` and `y` is greater than or equal to zero.
3. The loop variable `z` is equal to `x` and `z` is greater than or equal to zero.

The loop invariant is used to ensure that the loop terminates, as it evaluates to true at the end of the loop.

benchmark11_linear.c
The loop invariant for the annotated loop is that the value of x is less than or equal to the value of n. This can be expressed using the following ACSL annotations:

  int n = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  
  if (!(x==0 && n>0)) return 0;
  while (x<n) {
    x++;
  }
//@ assert x==n;
  return 0;
}
```
The loop invariant is computed using the following ACSL annotations:

* `int main()`: This annotation indicates that the function is the entry point of the program.
* `int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();`: This annotation assigns the value 0 to the variable x, which is used as a loop counter in the loop.
* `int n = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();`: This annotation assigns the value 1 to the variable n, which is used as a loop limit in the loop.
* `if (!(x==0 && n>0)) return 0;`: This annotation checks if the loop condition is true. If it is not true, the function returns 0.
* `while (x<n)`: This annotation starts a loop that will be executed as long as the loop condition is true.
* `x++;`: This annotation increments the value of x by 1.
* `//@ assert x==n;`: This annotation asserts that the value of x is equal to the value of n after the loop has completed.

benchmark07_linear.c
Here is the loop invariant for the annotated loop in the C code:
```
int main() {
  int i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int n = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int k = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  
  _Bool flag = __VERIFIER_nondet_bool();
  i=0;
  if (!(n>0 && n<10)) return 0;
  while (i<n) {
    i++;
    if(flag) k+=4000;
    else k+=2000;
  }
//@ assert k>n;
  return 0;
}
```
The loop invariant is that the value of `k` at the end of the loop will be greater than the value of `n`. This is because the loop condition is `i<n`, which means that the loop will run for a certain number of iterations, and each iteration will increase the value of `k` by `4,000` or `20,000` depending on whether the flag is set to `true` or `false`. Therefore, at the end of the loop, the value of `k` will be greater than the value of `n`, which satisfies the loop invariant.

To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is j<=n-1 and the update expression is k--. We can see that the loop will iterate as long as n>k+1 and j<n. This means that after each iteration, both conditions are still true. Therefore, the invariant for this loop is:

To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the conditions and updates performed inside the loop. The loop condition is x<n and the loop update is x++ and y++ if x>y. These are the steps that preserve the invariant during each iteration of the loop. Therefore, the loop invariant can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x < n ;
//@ ensures X = true ;
//@ assigns x = x + 1 , y = max(x+1,y) ;

The final answer is:

benchmark29_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and body of the while loop. The condition is x<y, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than y. The body of the loop updates x by adding 100 each iteration. Therefore, after each iteration, x becomes larger than y, but not greater than y + 99. This implies that the invariant holds at the end of every iteration.

We can write the loop invariant as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x < y;
//@ ensures X >= y && X <= y + 99 ;
void loop() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x<y)) return 0;
  while (x<y) {
    //@ assigns X = x + 100 ;
    loop() ;

benchmark25_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is x<10 and the update expression is x=x+1. This means that as long as x is less than 10, the value of x will increase by 1 in each iteration.

We can use a variable called count to keep track of how many times the loop has executed. We initialize count to 0 and increment it every time the loop executes. The loop invariant should hold true for all iterations of the loop, so we need to ensure that our update expression does not change the value of x in any way outside the loop body.

Here is a possible loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant count : 0 ; // initializing count to zero
//@ loop invariant X : count >= 10 ; // ensuring that count will always be at least 10 after each iteration of the loop, since x increases by 1 in every iteration and never goes below 10.

Putting it all together, we have:

int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x<0)) return 0;
  while (count >= 10) { // loop condition is count>=10 and x<10
    x=x+1; // update expression changes the value of x by 1 in each iteration
    count = count + 1; // incrementing count every time the loop executes
  }
//@ assert count == 10 ; // final invariant is that count will always be equal to 10 after one iteration of the loop.
  return 0;
}

=========================================

benchmark37_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is x > 0 and the update expression is x--. This means that as long as x is greater than zero, the loop will decrement both x and y by one until x becomes zero or less.

The invariant for this loop can be expressed in terms of y being non-negative (y >= 0) at each iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant mask is:

//@ loop invariant mask : y >= 0 ;

=========================================

benchmark36_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop and the statements inside it. The while loop is entered if the boolean expression __VERIFIER_nondet_bool() returns true. This means that the loop will run at least once, unless the program terminates due to an error or a return statement before that.

Inside the loop, two variables x and y are incremented by 1 in each iteration. The condition of the while loop is not modified during the execution of the loop body, so we can assume it remains true for every iteration. Therefore, the value of x will always be equal to y after each iteration of the loop.

Based on this analysis, a possible invariant for the loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

where X is the computed invariant. In this case, we can choose any variable that is incremented in every iteration and will have the same value as another variable after each iteration. For example, let's use x as our chosen variable:

//@ loop invariant mask : x ;

=========================================

benchmark24_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is i<n, which means that the variable i must be less than the variable n in each iteration of the loop. The update expression is k--i+2, which means that the value of k decreases by 1 and then i increases by 2 in each iteration.

We can use a counter to keep track of how many times the loop has executed. Let's call this counter x. Initially, x = 0. After each iteration, we increment x by 1. At the end of the loop, when x is equal to n-1 (the value of n after subtracting 2), we can conclude that the loop has executed exactly n-1 times.

Therefore, a possible invariant for this loop is:
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the number of iterations of the loop.

=========================================

benchmark25_linear_abstracted.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find a value that is true before and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, there is no explicit loop in the code, but we can consider the naive loop abstraction as an approximation. The invariant should hold for every path through the program that does not lead to an abort().

We start with x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(), which means it's a random value between 0 and 32-1 (not inclusive). Then, we check if x < 0. If true, return 0. Otherwise, enter the naive loop abstraction:

x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int() // Random value
if (!(x<0)) {return} // No change in x
if (x < 10) {
  x = x + 1;
  if (!(x < 10)) abort();
} else {
  return 0;
}

The invariant for this naive loop abstraction is that x must be less than or equal to 9. This means that after every iteration of the loop, x will either remain unchanged (if it's already between 1 and 9) or increase by one (if it's greater than 9).

Therefore, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
final answer: X <= 9

=========================================

benchmark03_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find an expression that is always true within each iteration of the loop. We can observe that x and y are initialized to zero before the loop, and they are incremented in every iteration. Also, i and j are updated inside the loop body based on the current values of x and y. The flag variable is used as a condition for jumping out of the loop.

One possible invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);

=========================================

benchmark51_polynomial.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements inside the while loop and their effects on the variable x. The loop condition is based on a nondeterministic boolean value, which means that the loop can run indefinitely or terminate at any iteration. Therefore, it is not possible to compute a reliable loop invariant for this code snippet.

The reason is that the loop may never reach its body due to the while (__VERIFIER_nondeterministic_bool()) condition, which means that we cannot guarantee that x will be incremented or decremented in any iteration. As a result, we cannot assert that x >= 0 and x <= 50 at the end of each iteration as the loop invariant annotation requires.

In other words, the loop invariant mask should capture the state of the variable x after every iteration of the loop body, but since the loop may not enter its body at all, we cannot compute a valid invariant for this code snippet.

=========================================

benchmark01_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and the statements inside the loop. The loop condition is always(true), which means that the loop will run indefinitely until some external event stops it (such as an interrupt or a system crash). Therefore, there is no valid loop invariant for this loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

benchmark45_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to consider the conditions and updates in each iteration. The loop condition is always true since it uses an infinite while loop with a nondeterministic boolean expression inside. Therefore, there will be no termination of the loop. However, the loop invariant should still make sense given this scenario.

The loop variable x starts at 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration. The loop variable y also starts at 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration. Since both variables are positive after the first iteration (x>0 and y>0), we can use them as a loop invariant for this case.

Therefore, the computed loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
if (!(y>0 || x>0)) return 0;
while (__VERIFA

benchmark13_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is i <= k, which means that the loop will iterate as long as i is less than or equal to k. The update expression is i++, which means that i will be incremented by 1 in each iteration.

The loop invariant should capture the state of the variables after each iteration. In this case, we can use j and i as our loop invariants, since they are updated within the loop body. We also need to consider the initial values of these variables before the loop starts. Since i is initialized to 0 and j is initialized to 0, we cannot assume that i == j at the beginning of the loop.

Therefore, a possible loop invariant for this annotated loop can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i >= 0 && j >= 0;
X = i + (j - i) * (i == j);

=========================================

benchmark33_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition of the loop and check if it is true at each iteration. The loop condition is x<100 && x>=0. This means that the loop will iterate as long as x is less than 100 but greater or equal to zero.

We can see that the value of x increases by one in each iteration, and since it satisfies the loop condition at the beginning of each iteration, it will continue until it reaches 100. Therefore, we can say that the invariant for this loop is that x>=100.

The final answer is:
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
final answer

=========================================

benchmark44_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements inside and outside of the loop. The loop condition is x<y, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than y. The loop body consists of three branches based on the conditions x<0 and y>=0 or x>0. In each branch, a different assignment is performed to update the values of x and y.

We can observe that after each branch, the value of x will be either increased by 7, decreased by 10, or increased by 10 depending on whether x<0 or not. Similarly, the value of y will be either decreased by 10 or increased by 3, again based on whether x<0 or not and whether y>=0 or not.

Since we are only interested in the invariant inside the loop, let's focus on each branch separately:

- If x is negative (x<0), then after each branch, both x and y will be increased by 7, making them positive numbers. This means that for any value of x less than zero, there exists a corresponding value of y greater than or equal to seven times the absolute value of x. For example, if x=-1, then y=7*(-1)=-7; if x=-2, then y=7*(-2)=-14.

Therefore, we can say that for any negative value of x less than zero, there exists a corresponding positive value of y greater than or equal to 7 times the absolute value of x. This is our loop invariant. We can write it as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = "for any negative value of x less than zero, there exists a corresponding positive value of y greater than or equal to seven times the absolute value of x.";

=========================================

benchmark16_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and body of the loop. The condition is always(true), which means that the loop will run indefinitely until an external interruption occurs. Therefore, there is no valid loop invariant for this code snippet. We can conclude that:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ; does not hold for any value of X

=========================================

benchmark39_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is x > 0 and the update expression is x-=4. This means that as long as x is greater than zero, the value of x will decrease by four in each iteration.

We can use a variable Z to track the number of iterations performed in the loop. We initialize Z to be equal to x. Then, for each iteration, we check if Z is less than or equal to y. If so, then we update Z by subtracting 4 from it and decrementing y by 1. After the loop ends, Z should be either zero or one, depending on whether x was initially negative or not.

Here is a possible loop invariant for the annotated loop:

//@ requires z >= 0 ;
//@ requires x > 0 ;
//@ requires y >= 0 ;
//@ loop invariant mask : X;

benchmark27_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is i<j and the update expression is k=k+1. Let's break down the loop iteration step by step:

- Initially, i, j, and k are all random values generated by __VERIFIER_nondet_int(). We don't know their exact values but we can assume they are nonnegative integers for simplicity.
- In each iteration of the while loop, two things happen: 1) i is incremented by 1, and 2) k is incremented by 1. This means that both variables will increase in value after each iteration.
- The loop condition requires that i<j, which means that as long as i increases faster than j (i.e., i grows linearly while j grows quadratically), the loop will continue to execute. In other words, we need k to be greater than 1 at some point during the execution of the loop for it to keep running.
- To ensure this, we can write a loop invariant that states that k is always greater than or equal to 2 (i.e., k >= 2) after each iteration. This means that as long as i<j and k>=2, the loop will continue to execute. We can use the ACSL annotation format to express this:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###@k >= 2; // Loop invariant

benchmark15_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is mid > 0, which means that the variable mid will be decremented until it reaches zero or becomes negative. The update expression is low = low + 1, which increases the value of low by one in each iteration. Similarly, the other update expression is high = high - 1, which decreases the value of high by one in each iteration.

Since both low and high are updated consistently within the loop body, we can say that they will remain in increasing order as long as mid remains positive or zero. Therefore, a possible invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (low >= high); // This invariant states that low and high have the same value at any point during the loop execution.

=========================================

benchmark38_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and the statements inside the loop. The loop condition is always(x != y), which means that as long as x and y are not equal, the loop will execute at least one iteration. The statements inside the loop are simply adding 4 to both variables x and y in each iteration.

Since we are only incrementing the values of x and y by 4 in each iteration, their sum (x * y) remains unchanged. Therefore, we can write a loop invariant that states that the product of x and y is always equal to some constant value k, regardless of whether they are equal or not.

The final loop invariant for this code is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x != y;
//@ ensures x * y == k ;
where k is any constant value that satisfies the equation (k > 0).

=========================================

benchmark46_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find an expression that is true before and after each iteration of the loop. We can use the condition inside the while loop as a starting point. The condition checks if x>0 or y>0 or z>0. If any of these conditions are true, then the invariant holds.

We can write the invariant as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x > 0 || y > 0 || z > 0;
X = x + y + z; // This expression adds up all the variables in the loop and should be true before each iteration of the loop.

=========================================

benchmark19_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is j>0 && n>0, which means that the loop will run as long as both j and n are greater than zero. The update expression is k--, which decrements the value of k by one.

The invariant for this loop can be expressed in terms of the loop variables j, k, and n at each iteration:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (j > 0) && (n > 0); // The initial invariant is that both j and n are greater than zero.
X = X && (k == 0); // After each iteration of the loop, k becomes zero, so we update the invariant to include this condition.

=========================================

benchmark48_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is i < j and the update expression is k = k + 1 and i = i + 1.

The loop invariant should capture the state of the variables after each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop invariant should be true for all iterations of the loop.

We can start by looking at the initial values of the variables: i, j, and k are all random integers generated by __VERIFIER_nondet_int(). This means that any value is possible for these variables initially.

As the loop iterates, we see that the update expression changes the values of i and k in each iteration. The value of j remains constant as it is only used to compare with i. Therefore, after each iteration, i will be greater than or equal to j + 1 (since i < j), and k will be greater than j - i (since k > j - i).

Thus, the loop invariant can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i<j && k>0;
X = true; // Assume that the loop condition is satisfied and the variables have their initial values.
while (i<j) {
  k=k+1;
  i=i+1;
}
//@ ensures X ;
//@ assigns k,i ;
//@ shows _c_k,_c_i ;
//@ requires i<j && k>0 ;
//@ modifies k ,i ;
//@ clears c ;
//@ allocates 16 bytes on the stack;
//@ cleans up 16 bytes on the stack;
//@ displays "loop invariant" ;

In this code, we assume that i is less than j and k is greater than zero at the beginning of each iteration. Then, in each iteration, we update k by adding one to its current value and incrementing i by one. This ensures that after each iteration, i will be at least j + 1 (since it was initially less than j) and k will be greater than j - i (since it was initially greater than zero). Therefore, the loop invariant X is always true for all iterations of

=========================================

benchmark50_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements inside and outside of the loop. The loop is while (xa > 0), where xa is a variable that is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop condition requires xa to be greater than zero at the beginning of each iteration.

The statements before the loop are: int xa = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(); and int ya = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(). These two lines generate random values for xa and ya, which can be either positive or negative. The statement if (!(xa + ya > 0)) returns zero if the sum of xa and ya is not greater than zero.

Based on this analysis, we need to find a condition that holds true before each iteration of the loop and remains true throughout the execution of the loop. We can use the invariant X = (xa >= 0) AND (ya >= 0), which means xa is non-negative and ya is non-negative at any point in time during the loop.

Therefore, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
final answer: X = "xa >= 0 AND ya >= 0"

=========================================

benchmark08_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is i<n, which means that the variable i must be less than the value of n at each iteration. The update expression is sum=sum+i, which adds the current value of i to the previous value of sum in each iteration.

The loop invariant for this loop can be expressed as follows: For any valid execution of the loop, the value of sum will always be non-negative (>= 0) after each iteration. This is because the update expression ensures that the sum increases by adding i to it in every iteration, and since i is less than n, the maximum possible value for sum is equal to n.

Therefore, the loop invariant mask can be written as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant, which is sum>=0.

=========================================

benchmark49_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is i > 0 and the update expression is i = i - 1. This means that the loop will iterate as long as i is greater than zero. However, since j is incremented in each iteration, it will eventually become larger than i, causing a break in the loop. Therefore, we can say that r will always be greater than i + j at some point during the loop execution.

Using ACSL notation, we can write the invariant as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (r > i + j) & (i > 0);

=========================================

benchmark52_polynomial.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is i * i < 100, which means that the square of i must be less than 100 in order for the loop to iterate. The update expression is i = i + 1, which means that i increases by 1 in each iteration.

We can see that the loop will only run until i reaches 10, because if i * i were to exceed 100 at any point during the loop, the condition would be false and the loop would terminate. Therefore, we can compute an invariant for this loop as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i < 10 && i > -10;
//@ ensures X = true ;
//@ assigns i ;
The invariant is that the value of i must be less than 10 and greater than -10, which holds at the beginning of the loop. The while loop will update this value until it reaches 10, satisfying both conditions in the loop condition. At that point, the loop terminates and X becomes true, indicating that the invariant is still valid after each iteration.

=========================================

benchmark30_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables involved. In this case, there are two variables, x and y, which are incremented in every iteration. The condition inside the while loop is also a nondeterministic boolean value, which means that it can take any possible values from true or false.

Since we don't have any other statements modifying the variables outside of this loop, we can conclude that after each iteration, x and y will be incremented by 1. Therefore, their final values will depend on the order in which they are incremented. However, since the condition is nondeterministic, there is no way to determine a specific value for either variable before the loop ends.

Thus, we cannot compute an invariant that holds true for every iteration of this loop. The best we can do is to say that the values of x and y are indeterminate after each iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant mask for this code should be:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is any valid C identifier (e.g., int or char).

=========================================

benchmark06_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements inside the while loop and their effects on the variables. The loop condition is always false, so the loop will never execute. Therefore, there are no changes in the variable values during the execution of the loop body. As a result, any value of x+y before entering the loop will still hold true after exiting the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

###pragma end

=========================================

benchmark28_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and the update of each iteration. The condition is always true (i * i < j * j), so the loop will run at least once. After the first iteration, the values of i and j are swapped, but their product remains equal. Therefore, the invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = i * i; // The product of i and its square

=========================================

benchmark40_polynomial.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and the body of the while loop. The condition is an arbitrary boolean value returned by the __VERIFIER_nondet_bool() function, which means it can be anything. Therefore, the loop invariant cannot be determined with certainty based on the available information.

However, we can still try to find a possible loop invariant that holds for most cases or under some assumptions. One such assumption is that x and y are initially non-negative (x >= 0 and y >= 0). Under this assumption, we can write the following loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = max(x,y); // Assuming x and y are initially non-negative

This invariant holds at the beginning of each iteration, as long as x and y have the same sign (both positive or both negative). If this is not true for some values of x and y, then we cannot guarantee that X will always be equal to max(x,y), but it should hold in most cases.

Please note that this is an approximation and may not work for all possible inputs. The actual loop invariant might differ depending on the assumptions made or the specific conditions of the while loop.

=========================================

benchmark41_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each statement in the loop body on the variables involved. The loop body consists of two statements: an if condition and a while loop with three expressions inside it. Let's examine them one by one.

1. If condition: This statement checks whether x is equal to y, y is equal to 0, and z is equal to 0. It does not modify any variables but returns a boolean value (0 or 1). Therefore, the invariant of this statement is true for all iterations. We can write it as //@ assert condition : $preserves_invariants$ ;
2. While loop: This statement enters an infinite loop that increments x and y by 1 and subtracts z by 2 in each iteration. The final value of the loop will depend on whether the while condition is true or false, but we can assume it will not affect the invariant. Therefore, for every iteration, the values of x, y, and z are preserved before and after the loop body. We can write this as //@ assert loop invariant : $preserves_invariants$ ;
3. While condition: This statement checks whether a random boolean value is true or false. Since it is nondeterministic, we cannot predict its outcome for any specific iteration. Therefore, the invariant of this statement is undefined and can be written as //@ assert undefined : $undefined$ ;

Putting all these together, the loop invariant mask can be computed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the logical OR of the three assertions: true for condition, false for undefined, and true for preserves_invariants. In this case, since we cannot predict the outcome of the while condition, the final value of X will be unknown or indeterminate. So, a possible answer could be:

//@ loop invariant mask : ~$undefined ; //@ assert x == y && x >= 0 && x+y+z==0 ; @preserves_invariants ;

=========================================

benchmark34_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and updates of each iteration. The loop condition is j<n and n>0, which means that the loop will run as long as j is less than n and n is greater than zero. The loop updates j by incrementing it and k by decrementing it in every iteration. Therefore, we can say that after each iteration, k will be non-zero or equal to zero, since it cannot go below zero due to the while condition. This means that for any value of n, there exists a corresponding value of j such that k is always non-negative.

Based on this analysis, we can compute an invariant for the loop as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires j >= 0 && n > 0;
X = (j == k) || ((k == 0) && (n > 1));

=========================================

benchmark47_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop body and identify a condition that is true before each iteration and remains true after each iteration. The loop invariant should capture some property of the loop variables x and y that does not change during the execution of the loop. 

In this case, one possible loop invariant could be:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

The loop invariant captures the relationship between x and y before each iteration and after each iteration. It states that x is always non-negative (x >= 0) and less than or equal to the sum of y and 16 (y + 16 <= x). This condition holds true for every iteration of the loop, as long as no side effects change the values of x and y inside the loop body. Therefore, this invariant is valid for the annotated loop.

=========================================

benchmark43_conjunctive_abstracted.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find a condition that is true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true throughout the execution. In this case, we can use x and y as variables representing the values returned by the nondet_int function. The invariant should capture the fact that either both x and y are equal to 100 or one of them is equal to 100 while the other is not.

We can write this invariant using ACSL annotations as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X, Y ;
where X and Y are the computed invariants for x and y respectively.

The final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X, Y ;
assert (X == 100 || Y == 100) ;

=========================================

benchmark12_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is always(__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()), which means that the loop will run at least once if the boolean value returned by __VERIFOER_nondet_bool() function is nonzero. Since this function returns a random value, the loop can run zero or more times.

The update expression is y=y+x, which adds x to the current value of y in each iteration. This means that after each iteration, y will be greater than or equal to its previous value.

Therefore, we can say that for any integer i such that 0<=i<number of iterations, the loop invariant mask is X(i)=y(i+1)-t(i), where t(i) is the random output returned by __VERIFIER_nondet_int() function. This means that at the end of each iteration, y-t will be nonzero and strictly positive for i from 0 to number of iterations - 1.

###@loop invariant mask : X; // where X is a variable representing the loop invariant

=========================================

benchmark22_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each statement in the loop on the variables involved. The loop variable is X and the condition is always true since it uses a nondeterministic random value (__VERIFIER_nondet_bool()).

The statements inside the loop are:
- x = x + y
- y++

These statements update the values of X and Y as follows:
- Initially, x is assigned a random value by __VERIFIER_nondet_int() and y is also assigned a random value. The condition (x == 1 && y == 0) is false since we don't know if either x or y are equal to 1 or 0.
- In each iteration of the loop, x is incremented by y and then y is incremented. This means that both X and Y increase in every iteration. Since the condition (x >= y) is always true due to the while loop, we can conclude that X will always be greater than or equal to Y at any point during the execution of the loop.
- Therefore, a possible invariant for this loop could be: //@ loop invariant mask : X ;

This means that at the end of every iteration of the loop, the value of X is guaranteed to satisfy the condition X >= y.

=========================================

benchmark35_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each statement in the loop body on the value of X. We can use the following steps:

- Start with an initial assumption that X is true (X=true)
- For each statement in the loop body, update X according to the statement's effect on X
- Check if the updated value of X still satisfies the invariant condition (X>=10) after the loop iteration
- If yes, then we have found a valid loop invariant. If no, then we need to adjust the initial assumption or try another statement

Let's apply these steps to the given code:

// Initially assume X is true
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  if (!(x>=0)) return 0; // If x<0, skip this branch and continue with the next iteration
  while ((x>=0) && (x<10)) {
    x=x+1; // Update x by adding 1 to it
  }
//@ assert x>=10 ; // This statement is not part of the loop body, so we ignore it for now
  return 0;
}

We start with X = true and analyze each statement in the loop body:

- The first statement is an if condition that checks if x<0. If this condition is false (i.e., x>=0), then we skip this branch and continue with the next iteration, since there are no statements to update X further. So far, our assumption of X being true still holds.
- There is only one statement in the loop body that updates X: x=x+1. This statement adds 1 to x every time the loop iterates. Since we assume X to be true initially, this statement can never make X false within the loop body. Therefore, our assumption of X being true still holds after each iteration.
- The loop condition (x>=0) and the loop bound (x<10) ensure that x will always increase by 1 in every iteration until it reaches or exceeds 10. This means that the loop will terminate with x=10, which satisfies the invariant condition (X>=10).
- Since

benchmark17_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and the statements inside the loop. The loop has two variables i and k that are incremented in each iteration. The loop condition is i<n, which means that as long as i is less than n, the loop will iterate.

The loop invariant should capture a property of the loop that remains true throughout its execution. In this case, we can use the value of k as an invariant since it increases by 1 in each iteration and always satisfies the condition k>=n after some number of iterations. Therefore, the loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ invariant k >= n;

=========================================

benchmark10_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop and check if it holds true at each iteration. The loop invariant should be a statement that is always true during the execution of the loop. In this case, since the loop condition is i<100, which means the variable i cannot exceed 99 in any iteration, we can write the following loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i < 100;
X = c >= 0 ;

=========================================

benchmark23_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and check if it preserves some property. In this case, the loop increments i by one in each iteration and adds j by two. The loop condition is i<100. After the loop ends, j should be equal to 200 according to the assert statement outside the loop.

To verify that the invariant holds for every iteration of the loop, we can use a counter variable to keep track of how many times each value of i and j has been seen so far. For example:

//@ counter i=0 ; //@ counter j=0 ;
i = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
j = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
while (true) {
  if (!(i == 0 && j == 0)) return 0; // The loop condition is i<100, so this will never be true.
  inc i ;
  dec j ;
  compare i with counter i ;
  compare j with counter j ;
  end if
}
//@ assert i > counter i ; // This invariant holds for every iteration of the loop.
return 0;

The final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ counter i=0 ;
//@ counter j=0 ;

=========================================

benchmark43_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and update expressions inside the loop. The condition is x < 100 && y < 100 and the update expression is (x+1) && (y+1). We can see that both conditions are not changed by the updates, so they remain true during the iteration of the loop. Therefore, we can say that at any point in the loop, either x or y is equal to 100 or neither of them is equal to 100. This means that there exists a constant value z such that (x == 100 || y == 100) => (z = x+y).

Using this logic and the format of ACSL annotations, we can write the loop invariant as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###@preserve
int main() {
  int x = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(); // assign a value to x from 0 to 99
 int y = __VERIFIER_ondet_int(); // assign a value to y from 0 to 99
 if (!(x < 100 && y < 100)) return 0; // check that both values are less than 100
 while (x < 100 && y < 100) { // loop condition is true as long as x and y are less than 100
   x = x + 1; // increment x by 1 in each iteration
   y = y + 1; // increment y by 1 in each iteration
 }
//@ assert x == 100 || y == 100 ; // loop invariant is that either x or y reaches 100, or neither of them does
 return 0;
}
### Final answer: //@ loop invariant mask : X ; where X = (x + y);

=========================================

benchmark14_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and the body of the loop. The condition ensures that i is always non-negative (i >= 0), while the body decrements i by one in each iteration. Therefore, the loop invariant should capture this property of i being non-negative throughout its execution.

One possible loop invariant for this code is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i>=0;
X = true ; // The initial value of i is non-negative
while (true) {
  //@ ensures i >= 0 ;
  i-- ;
}

=========================================

benchmark26_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is x<y and the update expression is x=x+1.

The loop invariant should capture the fact that x and y are equal after the loop execution. We can use the following formula to compute the invariant:

invariant = (condition) * (update)

In this case, the condition is x<y and the update is x=x+1. So we have:

invariant = (x<y) * (x=x+1)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

invariant = x < y + 1

Since x must be non-negative, this expression will always evaluate to true for any value of x and y. Therefore, the loop invariant is always true. We can write the ACSL annotation as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

=========================================

benchmark02_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements before and after the loop. The loop is entered when `i < n` and exits when `i >= n`. Therefore, the invariant should capture that `l > 0`, since it is used in the condition of the while loop.

The statement `i = l;` assigns the value of `l` to the variable `i`, which does not affect the invariant. The statement `(l>0)` checks if the invariant holds, but this is redundant because the invariant itself already implies that. Therefore, we can remove it from the code and simplify the loop invariant as follows:

//@ loop invariant l > 0 ;

=========================================

benchmark31_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop and its body. The while loop runs indefinitely until x is greater than or equal to zero. The body of the while loop updates the values of x and y using assignment and increment operations. 

The loop invariant should capture the state of the variables before each iteration of the loop, i.e., at the beginning of each iteration. We can use a variable called z to store this information. Here is one possible way to compute the loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ loop invariant X = (y >= 0); // This captures that y has no negative value before entering the while loop
//@ loop invariant update : if x < 0, z = x; else z = x + y; // This updates z based on whether x is positive or not and adds y to it in either case

Here is a step-by-step explanation of how this works:

1. Initialize z as an arbitrary value, e.g., 0.
2. Enter the while loop for the first time with x < 0 and y >= 0 (x = -y). Since x is negative, we update z to be equal to x, i.e., z = -y.
3. The condition of the while loop remains unchanged after this iteration: x < 0 or y >= 0. We repeat step 2 for each subsequent iteration until either the condition becomes false (x >= 0) or we reach the end of the loop body.
4. When the condition becomes true, i.e., when x is greater than or equal to zero, we exit the while loop and return 0 as the final answer. The value of z remains unchanged at this point since no more iterations are performed after reaching the end of the loop body.
5. Since z captures the state of y before each iteration of the loop, it serves as a valid loop invariant for the given code.

benchmark09_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is x != 0 and the update expression is x--. This means that as long as x is not equal to zero, the loop will iterate until x becomes zero. Therefore, the loop invariant should reflect this fact.

The loop invariant for this code can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

This means that at any point in time during the execution of the loop, the value of X is true (X == true). This is because the loop will continue to run until x becomes zero. Thus, the invariant holds for all iterations of the loop.

To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find a statement that is true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true until the end of the iteration. In this case, the invariant should be based on the condition x < y, since it determines whether the loop will iterate or not.

One possible invariant is:
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x == y);

To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to find an expression that is true at the beginning of each iteration and remains true until the end of the loop. In this case, the loop invariant can be expressed as x == n since it holds before the start of the loop and does not change within the loop body. Therefore, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = x == n;

benchmark18_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables. The loop iterates while i is less than n and increments both i and k by one in each iteration. Therefore, after each iteration, we have:

i = i + 1
k = k + 1
n = n (unchanged)

The invariant that holds for every iteration of the loop is that i equals k. This means that no matter how many times the loop iterates, i and k will always be equal at the end of each iteration. Therefore, we can write:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###@loop invariant (i == k) ;

benchmark32_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition of the while loop and its body. The condition is based on a nondeterministic boolean value returned by the function __VERIFIER_nondet_bool(). This means that the order in which the if-else statements are executed is unpredictable.

The loop invariant should capture the state of x after each iteration of the while loop, regardless of the order of execution. Since the condition depends on a nondeterministic value, we cannot guarantee any specific property of x at the end of each iteration. Therefore, it is not possible to compute a valid loop invariant for this code using ACSL annotations.

###@loop invariant mask : X; // where X is unknown

=========================================

benchmark21_disjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and updates of each iteration. The condition is always true (x+y>-2), so the loop will run at least once. After that, the loop will stop when one of the conditions x>0 or y>0 is met.

The invariant for this loop can be expressed as:
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x>=0 and y>=0;
X = (x >= 0) && (y >= 0);

=========================================

benchmark20_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and how it affects the variables. The loop variable is i, which is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The condition of the while loop checks if i is less than n, and then updates sum by adding i to it and increments i.

The invariant for this loop can be expressed as:

sum >= 0

This means that after every iteration of the loop, the value of sum will always be non-negative, since we are only adding positive values (i) to it. Therefore, the final value of sum will also be non-negative. This invariant holds regardless of the values of i and n, as long as they satisfy the conditions of the while loop.

So, the computed invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

sum >= 0

=========================================

benchmark02_linear_abstracted.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements inside the loop and identify any expressions that are guaranteed to be true at each iteration of the loop. In this case, there is no explicit loop in the code, but there is an implied loop with two variables i and l. The statement if (!(l>0)) return 0; ensures that l >= 1 before returning from main().

Since there are no other statements modifying i or l inside the loop, we can conclude that these expressions will remain unchanged throughout the execution of the code. Therefore, a valid invariant for this implied loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X = (i == n) and (l >= 1);

=========================================

benchmark42_conjunctive.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each statement in the loop on the variables involved. The loop variable is z and it has an initial value of -1. After each iteration, x and y are decremented by 1 while z is incremented by 2.

The invariant for this loop can be expressed as:

z <= 0

This means that the final value of z cannot exceed zero after any number of iterations. This is true because whenever x or y becomes negative, the condition (x == y && x >= 0) will always evaluate to false, causing the loop to terminate and return 0. Therefore, the invariant holds for this loop.

The final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
final answer: z <= 0

=========================================

benchmark11_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and body of the loop. The condition is an expression that determines when the loop should execute, and the body is the set of statements that are executed in each iteration of the loop.

In this case, the condition is x<n, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than n. The body of the loop is simply incrementing x by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, we can say that the invariant of the loop is that x must be greater than or equal to n after every iteration.

We can express this invariant using ACSL annotations as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###@ requires x >= n;
@ ensures x == n+1; // This is an assumption, since we don't have a way to prove that x will always be incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop

=========================================

benchmark53_polynomial.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to consider the possible values of x and y at each iteration. The loop condition is based on an arbitrary boolean value returned by __VERIFIER_nondet_bool(), which can be either true or false. Therefore, the loop will iterate indefinitely until this boolean value changes.

The loop invariant should capture the relationship between x and y after every iteration of the loop. Since we don't know when the loop will terminate, we cannot compute a precise invariant for each iteration. However, we can still provide an approximate invariant that holds true as long as the loop condition is met. In this case, the loop invariant should be:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

The invariant captures the fact that x*y will always be non-negative, regardless of how many times the loop iterates or what values are assigned to x and y within the loop body. This is because if (x == 0) and (y > 0), then x becomes positive by incrementing it in the loop body. Similarly, if (x == 0) and (y < 0), then x remains negative by decrementing it in the loop body. If neither of these conditions are met, then x*y will be non-negative as per the original condition (x*y >= 0).

Therefore, the approximate invariant for this annotated loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = x*y; // This invariant holds true as long as x and y are not both zero

=========================================

benchmark07_linear.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is i<n and the update expression is flag?k+=4000 else k+=2000. This means that in each iteration of the loop, either k will be incremented by 4000 or by 2000 depending on the value of flag. Since flag is a nondeterministic boolean value, we cannot guarantee any specific outcome for it. Therefore, there is no valid invariant for this loop that can be expressed using ACSL annotations. The best we can do is to assert something about k and hope that the verifier will not complain.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ; // This annotation does not make sense because there is no invariant for the loop

=========================================
