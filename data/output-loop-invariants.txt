The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant s == sum_of_v_from_0_to_i ; 

where `sum_of_v_from_0_to_i` represents the cumulative sum of all values stored in `v` from index 0 to `i`. This invariant holds at the beginning and end of each iteration, as well as before entering the loop.

=========================================

bin-suffix-5.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` modulo 8 remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant x % 8 == mask;

Since we want to end with //@ loop invariant mask : X ;, where X is the computed invariant, we have:

//@ loop invariant mask : (x % 8)

=========================================

eq1.c
The loop invariant is:

w <= x && y >= z;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, we know that `w` is less than or equal to `x`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `z`.

Here's how this invariant holds throughout the execution of the program:
- Initially, w = x and y = z.
- If a nondeterministic decision leads us to increment both w and x, then we know that w <= x still holds. Similarly, if we decrement both y and z, then y >= z still holds.
- In either case, our invariant remains true.

So the loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : w <= x && y >= z;

=========================================

odd.c
The loop invariant for this code is:

x % 4 == mask;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every increment operation inside the while loop, the remainder when divided by 4 should be equal to some value (mask). This condition holds true throughout all iterations.

//@ loop invariant mask : x % 4;

=========================================

eq2.c
The loop invariant is that the difference between `y` and `z` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop. This can be expressed as:

```
//@ loop invariant diff : (y - z) == w + 1;
```

This invariant holds because initially, `w`, `x`, and `y` are all equal to each other, so `(y-z)` is zero. Then in each iteration of the loop, both `y` and `z` increase by one, which means that their difference remains constant.

Finally, since we know that `y == z` at the end of the loop (from the assertion), it follows that initially `(y - z) == w + 1`, as required.

=========================================

const.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `s` remains unchanged between iterations. This can be formally stated as:

//@ loop invariant s == old(s);

This means that at the beginning and end of each iteration, the value of `s` does not change.

However, since we are interested in a more specific invariant for this problem, let's analyze the code further. The condition `__VERIFIER_nondet_uint()` is used to determine whether or not to increment `s`. This means that if `s == 0`, it will always be incremented (since the condition is true), and if `s != 0`, it won't be incremented.

With this in mind, we can conclude that:

//@ loop invariant s % 2 == old(s) % 2;

This invariant states that the parity of `s` remains unchanged between iterations. In other words, whether or not `s` is even (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is 0) does not change.

Finally, we can combine this with our initial observation about the value of `s`:

//@ loop invariant s % 2 == old(s) % 2;
//@ loop invariant s == old(s);

These two invariants together describe a more specific property that holds throughout the execution of the loop.

=========================================

linear-inequality-inv-a.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant s == i * __VERIFIER_nondet_uchar();

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, `s` equals to the product of `i` and the current value of `v`. This property holds throughout the entire execution of the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

even.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

// @loop invariant true : x == (i * 2);

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every execution of the body, the value of `x` will be equal to twice some integer `i`. This invariant holds because in each iteration, we add 2 to `x`, so it is always even.

=========================================

mod4.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

// @loop invariant true : x == (old_x + ((new_x - old_x) / 4)) * 4;

where `old_x` and `new_x` are the values of `x` before and after each iteration, respectively.

This invariant states that at any point during the execution of the loop, the value of `x` is equal to four times an integer plus its remainder. This can be proven by induction:

Base case: Initially, `old_x = 0`, so `(old_x + ((new_x - old_x) / 4)) * 4 == x`.

Inductive step: Assume that at some point during the loop's execution, the invariant holds for a given value of `x`. Then, in the next iteration:

`x' = (new_x - old_x) % 4 + ((old_x + ((new_x - old_x) / 4)) * 4)`
`= (new_x - old_x) % 4 + x`

So, `(old_x' + ((new_x' - old_x') / 4)) * 4 == x'`, which proves the invariant holds for `x'`.

// @loop invariant mask : !(x % 4);

bin-suffix-5.c
In this code, the loop invariant is that the least significant bit of 'x' remains unchanged throughout the execution of the while-loop. This can be expressed in ACSL annotations as follows:
//@ loop invariant mask : (1 == (x & 1));
This means that whenever the loop starts executing, it will continue to execute until the condition __VERIFIER_nondet_int() becomes false. During this execution, 'x' is incremented by 8 in each iteration and the least significant bit of 'x' remains unchanged. Once the while-loop finishes, the assertion //@ assert (x & 5) == 5; holds true because it confirms that the least significant bit of 'x' indeed remains 1 as stated by our loop invariant.

=========================================

    } else {
      --y; --z;
      //@ loop invariant mask2 : y == z && \forall integer i; 0 <= i < y => (z' = z - 1)' = z - 1;

//@ assert w == x && y == z;

=========================================

odd.c
In this code, the loop invariant is that the value of `x` is always odd. This can be expressed in ACSL as follows:
```c
/*@
  requires true;
  ensures  x % 2 == 1;
  loop_invariant mask : (x >= 0) && (x % 2 == 1);
*/
int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 1;
  while (__VERIFIER_nondet_int()) {
    x += 2;
  }
//@ assert x % 2;
  return 0;
}
```
The loop invariant `mask : (x >= 0) && (x % 2 == 1)` asserts that the value of `x` is always non-negative and odd. This holds initially, since `x = 1`, and it is maintained by the loop because each iteration increments `x` by an even number (specifically, 2), which does not change its parity (oddness). Therefore, at every point in the execution of this code, the value of `x` will be odd.

In this code, the loop invariant is that the value of `x` will always be a multiple of 4. This is because in each iteration of the while-loop, `x` gets incremented by 4. Therefore, if it was not a multiple of 4 before an iteration, it would become one afterwards.

The loop invariant for the given code is:
//@ loop invariant mask : (x == 1) || (x == 3) ;
This means that after each iteration of the loop, either x has a value of 1 or x has a value of 3.

=========================================

mod4.c
//@ loop invariant mask : (x == 16) || (x == 20) ;
The computed loop invariant is that after the loop has executed, either x will be equal to 16 or x will be equal to 20. This is because the loop increments x by 4 on each iteration until it reaches a multiple of 4. If x starts at 0, then after one iteration it will be equal to 4 and after two iterations it will be equal to 8. After three iterations, x will be equal to 12. Since the loop continues to execute indefinitely, it is possible that x could eventually reach a multiple of 4 greater than or equal to 16 (e.g., if x starts at 0 and runs for an even number of iterations). However, since x can only be incremented by multiples of 4, the loop will terminate when x reaches a multiple of 4 that is divisible by 8 (i.e., 16 or 20). Therefore, after the loop has executed, either x will be equal to 16 or x will be equal to 20.

The loop invariant is that the variables w, x, and y are updated in a way that satisfies the following conditions:

1. If w is incremented, then x is also incremented by 1.
2. If w is decremented, then x is also decremented by 1.
3. If y is incremented, then z is also incremented by 1.
4. If y is decremented, then z is also decremented by 1.

The loop invariant is satisfied because the conditions are checked in each iteration of the loop and the variables are updated accordingly.

To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the while loop. The while loop condition is nondeterministic, meaning it can take any value from the set of integers {0,1,...,9}. Therefore, each iteration of the loop will change x by 8 and its final value depends on the random choice made by the condition.

Since we cannot predict or guarantee what value x will have after each iteration, we cannot compute a valid invariant for this loop. The best we can do is to assert that x & 5 == 5 at some point during or after the loop, but this is not guaranteed either. Therefore, there is no loop invariant for this code.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

eq1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to check if the values of w, x and y are preserved in each iteration. The loop condition is based on a nondeterministic random number generator (nondet), which means that it can generate any value for the while loop.

Inside the loop body, there are two branches: one where w increases by 1, x also increases by 1 and y decreases by 1; another branch where y decreases by 1 and z decreases by 1. The invariant should capture that in both cases, w is equal to x and y is equal to z after each iteration.

One possible loop invariant for this code could be:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (w == x) && (y == z);

=========================================

odd.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the while loop. The only statement in this loop is an assignment of x by adding 2 to its current value. This means that after each iteration of the loop, x will have an incremented value. Therefore, the loop invariant can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x + 1) % 2; // The final value of x after the loop is always within the range [0, 1]

=========================================

eq2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to examine the values of variables inside and outside the loop. The loop variable is 'y', which is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The other variables are initialized with nondeterministic values from __VERIFIER_nondet_uint().

The loop invariant should capture the value of 'z' after every iteration of the loop, since it depends only on the loop variable and not on any external inputs or outputs. Therefore, the loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires y == z;
X = (y >= 1); // This ensures that 'z' will always be equal to 'y', since they are both incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.

=========================================

const.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is __VERIFIER_nondet_uint(), which is an unpredictable boolean value generated by the verifier tool. Therefore, it cannot be used as a reliable indicator of whether the loop will execute or not.

The only thing we know for sure is that s can take on two possible values: 0 and non-zero. The update expression is also s++, which means that whenever s is incremented, it becomes non-zero. Therefore, the invariant must be a function of these two values.

One possible loop invariant mask is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (s != 0) ? !s : s; // If s is not zero, then X is the negation of s. Otherwise, X is s itself.

To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and update of the variable x inside the while loop. The condition is __VERIFIER_nondet_int(), which means it's an arbitrary integer that verifier generates. The update is adding 2 to x.

Since x is updated in every iteration of the loop, its value will always be odd after each iteration due to the addition of 2. Therefore, we can compute a loop invariant for this code as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x >= 0) ? ~(~x & 1) : x; // if x is non-negative, the final value will be odd, otherwise it will be even

=========================================

mod4.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the while loop. The while loop condition is checked with __VERIFIER_nondet_int(), which is a pseudo-random integer generator. This means that the loop will run at least once and the value of x will change each time it runs.

Since x is incremented by 4 in every iteration, its final value after the loop ends will be a multiple of 4 (x = 0 + 4 * number_of_iterations). Therefore, we can say that the value of x will always satisfy the condition !(x % 4), which means x is not divisible by 4.

So, the invariant for this loop is:
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x != 0;
//@ ensures !(X % 4);
