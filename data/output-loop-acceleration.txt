array_3-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `i` at each iteration is less than or equal to half of `N`. This can be formally stated as:

//@ loop invariant i <= N/2;

This invariant holds because in each iteration, `i` either remains unchanged (when `A[i] == 0`) or increments by 1. Since the condition `A[i] != 0` is checked before incrementing `i`, we know that `i` will never exceed half of `N`.

//@ loop invariant mask : i <= N/2;

=========================================

functions_1-2.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code can be written as:

// @loop invariant x: odd;
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

simple_1-1.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code can be written as:

// @loop invariant x: x is even.

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every increment operation inside the while loop, `x` will always be an even number. This property holds true throughout the execution of the program.

//@ loop invariant mask : x % 2;

=========================================

simple_1-2.c
The loop invariant for this code would be:

//@ loop invariant 1 <= i && i <= 0x7ffffff; 

This is because the variable `i` (or in this case, `x`) starts at a value of 0 and increments by 2 each iteration until it reaches or exceeds 0x0fffffff. The range [1, 0x7ffffff] includes all possible values that `x` could take during the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : x;

=========================================

array_4.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant i >= 0 && i < N;
 
This means that at the beginning of each iteration, `i` is between 0 and `N-1`, inclusive. This property holds throughout the entire execution of the annotated code.

 //@ loop invariant mask : i;

=========================================

underapprox_2-2.c
The loop invariant is that the product of all powers of 2 up to and including `y` equals the value of `x`. This can be expressed as follows:

```
int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 0;
  unsigned int y = 1;

  while (x < 6) { 
    //@ assert 2^(x-1) <= y; // loop invariant
    x++; 
    y *= 2; 
   }

//@ assert x == 6;
}
```

//@ loop invariant mask : 2^(x-1) <= y ;

=========================================

underapprox_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `y` at each iteration is equal to `2^(x-1)`.

This can be expressed in ACSL format as follows:

//@ loop invariant \forall integer i; 0 <= i < x ==> y == (1 << i);
//@ loop invariant mask : X;

Here, `(1 << i)` represents the binary number with a `1` at position `i`, and all other positions are `0`. The expression `2^(x-1)` is equivalent to this because it can be written as `2^((x-1)-1) = (1 << (x-1))`.

=========================================

array_2-2-simple.c
The loop invariant is that the values of `A` and `B` are identical up to index `(SZ / 2) - 1`.

This can be formally stated as:

```
//@ loop invariant forall(i; 0 <= i && i < SZ/2; A[i] == B[i])
//@ loop invariant mask : X;
```

=========================================

array3.c
The loop invariant is:

 //@ loop invariant 0 <= i && i < N;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, `i` is between 0 and `N-1`, inclusive. This property remains true throughout the entire execution of the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= i && i < N;

=========================================

nested_1-1.c
The loop invariant for the inner loop is:

// @loop invariant y == 9 || (x & 1);

This means that at any point during the execution of the inner loop, either `y` has reached its maximum value (`9`) or `x` is odd.

And the loop invariant for the outer loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : x % 2;

=========================================

phases_1-2.c
The loop invariant is that the remainder of `x` divided by 2 is always zero. This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, we can be certain that `x` will be even.

Here's how this works:

- Initially, `x` is set to 0 and it remains even.
- In each iteration of the loop, if `x < 0xfff1`, then `x++` increments an odd number by one. Since incrementing an odd number results in another odd number (and not an even number), we can be certain that `x` will remain even at this point.
- If `x >= 0xfff1`, then `x += 2`. This adds two to the remainder of `x` divided by 2, which is always zero. Therefore, adding two also results in a multiple of 2.

So, we can conclude that for any iteration `i` of the loop, it holds that `(x % 2) == 0`.

//@ loop invariant mask : x % 2;

=========================================

const_1-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. This can be formally stated as:

//@ loop invariant \forall integer i; 0 <= i < 10,024 ==> x == 1;

This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, if we were to stop and examine the value of `x`, it would always be equal to 1.

Finally,

//@ loop invariant mask : x == 1 ;

=========================================

simple_2-1.c
The loop invariant is: `@loop invariant x <= 0x7fffffff;`

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and immediately before the increment operation, we know that `x` will be less than or equal to `0x7fffffff`.

//@ loop invariant mask : x <= 0x7fffffff ;

=========================================

phases_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` at each iteration is even.

 //@ loop invariant mask : ! (x % 2) ;

=========================================

simple_4-1.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

// @loop invariant x: 0 <= x && x % 2 == 0;

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every execution of the body, the condition `0 <= x` (x is non-negative) and `x % 2 == 0` (x is even) holds.

//@ loop invariant mask : x;

=========================================

nested_1-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` at each iteration of the outer loop is even. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant x == (i * 2) for some integer i;

This means that if we were to unwind the loops, the final value of `x` would always be a multiple of two.

The reason this holds true is because in each iteration of the outer loop, `x` increments by one and `y` resets to zero. In the inner loop, `y` increments up to 9 (inclusive), which means that when it reaches 10, it will reset back to zero again. Since `x` only increments once per iteration of the outer loop, its value at each iteration is always even.

//@ loop invariant mask : x == (i * 2) for some integer i;

=========================================

functions_1-1.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

// @loop invariant x: x >= 0; 

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and after every execution of the body (i.e., `f(x)`), it holds true that `x` is greater than or equal to zero.

//@ loop invariant mask : !!(x % 2);

=========================================

phases_2-2.c
The loop invariant is that the product of `y` and `x` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. This can be expressed as follows:

```
int main(void) {
  // ...
  while (x < y) { 
    if (x < y / x) { 
      x *= x; 
     } else { 
      x++; 
     }
   }

//@ assert \forall integer z :: z * x == z * y;
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

array_1-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `A[j]` equals `j`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`. This means that for all indices `k` in this range, we have:

```
//@ assert \forall integer k; 0 <= k < i ==> A[k] == k;
```

The loop invariant is also true at the beginning of each iteration. 

So, the final answer would be:
```
//@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer j; 0 <= j < i ==> A[j] == j;
```

=========================================

array_2-1-simple.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `A[j]` and `B[k]` are equal for all indices j, k such that 0 <= j < i and 0 <= k < SZ. This means that up to index i-1, both arrays A and B have been copied correctly.

//@ loop invariant forall int j; 0 <= j && j < i ==> A[j] == B[j];
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

diamond_1-2.c
The loop invariant is:

 //@ loop invariant y : y; 

This means that the value of `y` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The condition in the if-else statement only depends on the parity of `x`, which does not affect the value of `y`. Therefore, we can conclude that the assertion `(x % 2) == (y % 2)` holds at each iteration.

//@ loop invariant mask : y;

=========================================

array_2-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `A` at index `i` and the corresponding value in `B` are equal for all indices up to half of `SZ`.

Here's how you can compute it:

For each iteration, we have:
- `tmp = A[i];`
- `B[i] = tmp;`

So after this loop finishes, `A[SZ/2] == B[SZ/2]` because the values in both arrays are copied from one to another.

Here's how you can write it using ACSL annotations:

//@ assert \forall integer k; 0 <= k && k < SZ / 2 ==> A[k] == B[k];
//@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer k; 0 <= k && k < i ==> A[k] == B[k];

=========================================

diamond_2-2.c
The loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant y : y; 

This means that the value of `y` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. This makes sense because `y` is a nondeterministic input, and its value does not depend on the state of the variables within the loop.

However, we can also find another more interesting invariant:

//@ loop invariant x % 2 == y % 2; 

This means that at any point in time during the execution of the loop, `x` is always congruent to `y` modulo 2. This makes sense because each iteration of the loop either increments or decrements both `x` and `y` by an even number (0, 2, or 4), which does not change their parity.

So, we have two invariants:

//@ loop invariant y : y; 
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

simple_3-2.c
The loop invariant is: 

//@ loop invariant 1 <= i; // This line can be ignored, as it's not relevant to the problem.

However, since we are only interested in computing a loop invariant for the annotated loop including [invariant], let's focus on that. The given code does not have any explicit annotations of the form "[invariant]". Therefore, I will assume you meant to ask about the assertion "! (x % 2)" which is indeed inside an annotation.

The loop invariant can be computed as follows:

For each iteration i of the while-loop, we know that x = 2*i. This means that for all iterations i < N, we have x = 2*i < 2*N = N, since N is a short integer and hence at most 65535.

This implies that !(x % 2) holds true for every iteration of the loop until it terminates (i.e., when x >= N).

So, our computed invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : !((unsigned int)x & 1);

=========================================

diamond_1-1.c
The loop invariant is:

 //@ loop invariant y : y; 

This means that the value of `y` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The assertion `(x % 2) == (y % 2)` can be proved by considering two cases: when `y` is even and when it's odd.

When `y` is even, both `x` and `y` are even at the beginning of each iteration, so after incrementing either one or not, they remain even. 

When `y` is odd, again both `x` and `y` are odd initially. If `y % 2 == 1`, then `x++` makes them both odd; if `y % 2 != 0`, then `x += 2` also keeps them both odd.

In either case, the parity of `x` remains equal to that of `y`.

=========================================

underapprox_1-2.c
The loop invariant is that the remainder of `y` divided by `3` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.

Here's how to compute it:

Initially, before entering the loop, we have `x = 0`, and `y = 1`. The remainder of `1` divided by `3` is `1`.

Now, let's analyze what happens in each iteration. In each iteration, `x` increments by `1`, which doesn't affect the remainder of `y` divided by `3`. On the other hand, `y` doubles its value, but since doubling a number leaves its remainder modulo `3` unchanged (e.g., `2 * 1 = 2`, and `2 % 3 == 2 % 3`), the remainder remains the same.

Therefore, we can conclude that the loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : y % 3;

=========================================

simple_4-2.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code is:

//@ loop invariant 1 <= i && i <= n;

Here, `i` and `n` are not explicitly defined in the problem statement. However, we can infer that they represent some indices or counters within the context of the given while loop.

In reality, since there's no explicit iteration variable (`i`) nor a specific range for it (like 0 <= i < n), this invariant is incorrect and doesn't accurately capture any property about the code being executed.

=========================================

underapprox_2-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `y` is always a power of two, and it's equal to `2^(x-1)`.

Here's how we can prove this:

* Initially, `x = 0`, so `y = 1`. This satisfies our condition.
* In each iteration:
	+ We increment `x`.
	+ We multiply `y` by `2`.

So, after the first iteration (`x = 1`), `y = 2^(1-1) = 1 * 2^0 = 1`, which still satisfies our condition.

After the second iteration (`x = 2`), `y = 2^(2-1) = 1 * 2^1 = 2`.

In general, after `k` iterations (`x = k+1`), we have:

* `x = k + 1`
* `y = 2^(k-1)` (since it's the result of multiplying by `2` `(k-1)` times)

So, our loop invariant is that for all integers `i`, if `0 <= i < 6`, then `mask : y == 2^((x - 1))`.

//@ loop invariant mask: y == 2^(x-1);

=========================================

simple_2-2.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` at each iteration is one more than its previous value. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant x == old(x) + 1;

This means that if we consider some arbitrary point in time during the execution of the loop, and then go back to a previous state (i.e., "old" `x`), the difference between the current `x` and the old `x` is always equal to one.

//@ loop invariant mask : x == old(x) + 1;

=========================================

array_3-1.c
The loop invariant is:

`@loop invariant i < N || (A[i] == 0);`

This invariant states that at the beginning of each iteration, either `i` is less than `N`, or `A[i]` equals zero. This makes sense because as long as `A[i]` does not equal zero, we continue iterating until it becomes zero.

//@ loop invariant mask : i < N || (A[i] == 0);

=========================================

phases_2-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` is always less than or equal to its previous value.

 //@ loop invariant prev_x <= x;

This means that at any point during the execution of the while loop, we know that `x` has not decreased in value since the last iteration.

=========================================

array_2-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `A` at each index remains unchanged throughout the entire execution of the program.

Therefore, the computed invariant would be:

//@ loop invariant \forall integer k; 0 <= k < SZ ==> A[k] == tmp;

This means that for any given index `k`, if we were to execute this code up until and including the current iteration, then the value stored at `A[k]` would remain unchanged.

Finally,

//@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer k; 0 <= k < SZ ==> A[k] == tmp;

=========================================

const_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` remains unchanged throughout each iteration. Since we initialize `x` to 1 and then set it to 0 in every iteration, this means that at the end of the loop, `x` will still be equal to its initial value.

So, the computed invariant is:

//@ loop invariant x == 1;

=========================================

simple_3-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `x` at each iteration is always even. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant x == 2 * k for some integer k;

This means that `x` will always be a multiple of 2, which satisfies the condition in the assertion.

//@ loop invariant mask : x % 2;

=========================================

multivar_1-2.c
The loop invariant is that the difference between `y` and `x` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop. This can be expressed as follows:

```
//@ loop invariant diff: \abs(y-x) ; 
```

Here, `\abs{}` denotes the absolute value function.

This invariant holds because in each iteration of the loop, both `x` and `y` are incremented by 1, so their difference remains constant. The assertion at the end of the code is a consequence of this invariant: since `diff` is initially equal to `|y-x|=|x+1-(x+0)|=1`, it will remain equal to 1 throughout the loop, meaning that `x==y`.

=========================================

multivar_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the difference between `y` and `x` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant for (int i = 0; i < __VERIFIER_nondet_uint(); i++) { x + i == y ; }

However, since we are not interested in a specific number of iterations but rather the relationship between `x` and `y`, we can simplify this to:

//@ loop invariant mask : y - x ;

=========================================

overflow_1-1.c
The loop invariant for this annotated C code can be written as:

//@ loop invariant 0 <= i && i <= x; 

This means that at the beginning of each iteration, and immediately before the increment operation `x += 2`, the value of `i` is within the range [0, x]. This invariant holds true throughout all iterations.

The postcondition `!(x % 2)` can be proven by observing that in each iteration, `x` increases by an even number (2), so it will always be divisible by 2. Therefore, at the end of the loop when `x < 10`, we have `!(x % 2)`. 

The invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : x;

=========================================

array_1-1.c
The loop invariant is that the value of `A` at index `j`, where `0 <= j <= i`, is equal to `j`.

Here's how you can compute it:

Initially, when `i = 0`, there are no elements in `A`. The assertion holds because there is no element with index `10,023` (which is greater than the array size).

In each iteration of the loop, we assign `i` to `A[i]`. This means that for all indices `j` such that `0 <= j <= i`, `A[j] = j`.

The assertion states that `A[10,023] != 10,023`, which is true because there are only `20,048 - 1 = 20,047` elements in the array. Therefore, we can conclude that:

//@ loop invariant mask : \forall int k; 0 <= k <= i ==> A[k] == k;
This means for all indices `k` such that `0 <= k <= i`, the value of `A` at index `k` is equal to `k`.

=========================================

model: Nous Hermes 2 Mistral DPO
array_3-2.c
In this code, the loop iterates over all elements of array `A` until it finds an element that is equal to zero. The invariant we can compute for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= i < N && \forall integer j; 0 <= j < i ==> A[j] != 0 ;

This invariant states that `i` starts from 0 and goes up to but not including the length of array `A`, which is `N`. Also, it ensures that all elements before index `i` in the array are non-zero. This holds true for each iteration of the loop until a zero element is found or the end of the array is reached.

=========================================

functions_1-2.c
In this code, we have a loop that iterates until the variable `x` reaches a value of 0xffffff. Inside the loop, there is a function call to `f`, which updates the value of `x`. The goal of the loop invariant should be to ensure that `x` always holds an odd number during each iteration.

//@ loop invariant mask : (x % 2 == 1);

This loop invariant states that at every iteration, the remainder when `x` is divided by 2 must be equal to 1, which ensures that `x` will always hold an odd value inside the loop.

=========================================

Here is the computed loop invariant:

int main(void) {

  for (i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {
    A[i] = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
  }

  A[N-1] = 0;

  for (i = 0; A[i] != 0; i++) {
    //@ loop invariant mask : \valid(A + i);
    //@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer j; 0 <= j < i => A[j];
    //@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer j; i <= j < N => !A[j];
  }
}

=========================================

underapprox_2-2.c
In this code, the loop invariant is that after each iteration of the loop, the value of `y` will be a power of 2 equal to or greater than the current value of `x`. The initial condition for the invariant is also true since `y` starts at 1 and is a power of 2 (2^0 = 1).

//@ loop invariant mask : y == pow2(x);

=========================================

underapprox_1-1.c
In this loop, we are incrementing the value of 'x' and multiplying the value of 'y' by 2 in each iteration until 'x' becomes equal to or greater than 6. The initial values for both variables are given as 0 and 1 respectively. We need to find a loop invariant that holds true before every iteration of the loop.
//@ loop invariant y : [0, y] ---> {0} * 2^x;
//@ loop invariant x == (6 - 1);
//@ loop invariant y == 2 ^ (x + 1);

The computed invariant is:
//@ loop invariant mask : y == 2 ^ (x + 1) && x == (6 - 1);

=========================================

array_2-2-simple.c
int main(void) {
  int A[SZ] = {0};
  int B[SZ] = {0};
  int i;
  int tmp;

  for (i = 0; i < SZ; i++) {

    B[i] = tmp;
  }

//@ loop invariant mask : \forall integer j in 0..i; A[j] == B[j];
}

=========================================

array3.c
In this loop, the variable `A` is an array of size `N`, and we want to find the index `i` such that `A[i] == 0`. The loop invariant should express properties about the values in the array `A` up to index `i`, as well as the value of `i`.

//@ loop invariant //@ closed: {0..N-1} ;
//@ loop invariant 0 <= i < N && A[j] == __VERIFIER_nondet_int() for j in [0,i];
//@ loop invariant A[i] != 0;
//@ loop invariant \forall integer k; 0 <= k < i; A[k] == __VERIFIER_nondet_int();
//@ loop invariant \exists integer k; 0 <= k < N && k >= i && A[k] == 0;
//@ loop assigns A[], i;
//@ loop variant N - (i + 1);

The computed invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : 0 <= i < N && \forall integer j; 0 <= j < i => A[j] == __VERIFIER_nondet_int() && A[i] != 0;

=========================================

nested_1-1.c
In this code, the outer loop increments `x` until it reaches a value of `0x0fffffff`. The inner loop always executes exactly 10 times. Since the incrementation of `y` is not affected by any other variable or operation within the loops, we can use that fact to create an invariant for both loops combined.
//@ loop invariant (x >= 0 && x <= 0x0fffffff) && (y == 10);
This invariant states that `x` must be between 0 and `0x0fffffff`, inclusive, and `y` must always have a value of 10. This is true at the start of each iteration of both loops, so it remains true throughout their execution.

=========================================

phases_1-2.c
The loop invariant for the given code is:
//@ loop invariant \valid((&x)[0..1]);
//@ loop invariant (x >= 0) && (x <= 0xfff1 || x == 0xfff2);
//@ loop invariant !((x > 0xfff1) && (x % 2));
//@ loop invariant !(x < 0 || x % 4 == 0);
//@ loop invariant mask: \exists unsigned int i; (i >= 0) && (i <= x) && ((x - i) % 4 == 0);

=========================================

const_1-2.c
In this code, the loop does not modify the value of 'x' or 'y'. Therefore, we can use the initial values as a loop invariant. The computed invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : y == 0 && x == 1 ;

=========================================

simple_2-1.c
In this code, the loop is incrementing a variable 'x' until it reaches or exceeds the value of 0x0fffffff. Since we are not given any additional information about the initial value of 'x', we can assume that 'x' could be any non-negative integer less than 0x0fffffff before entering the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : x >= 0;
//@ loop invariant mask : x < 0x0fffffff;
//@ loop invariant mask : \forall int i; (0 <= i && i < x) => i == i;

The first two invariants state that 'x' is a non-negative integer less than 0x0fffffff. The third invariant states that all integers from 0 to 'x - 1' are valid and well-formed (i.e., they have the same value as themselves). This ensures that no overflow occurs during the loop execution, which would invalidate our invariants.

=========================================

phases_1-1.c
int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 0;

  while (x < 0x0fffffff) {
    if (x < 0xfff0) {

      x += 2;
    }
  //@ loop invariant mask : (x >= 0 && x <= 0x0ffffff);
  }

//@ assert !(x % 2);
}

=========================================

simple_4-1.c
In this code, we have a loop that subtracts 2 from the variable `x` until it becomes less than or equal to 1. The final value of `x` will be even because an odd number minus 2 would result in an even number but not vice versa. Therefore, the invariant for this loop is:
//@ loop invariant mask : x % 2 == 0;

=========================================

nested_1-2.c
In this code, the outer loop increments `x` until it reaches a value greater than or equal to 0x0fffffff. The inner loop always executes exactly 10 times and increments `y`. Since `x` is incremented after each iteration of the outer loop, we can infer that `x` will be even at every iteration of the outer loop. Therefore, the invariant for this annotated loop would be:
//@ loop invariant mask : x % 2 == 0 ;

=========================================

functions_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given annotated code, we need to analyze what properties remain true at each iteration of the loop. The function `f` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we will assume that it does not modify any variables other than `x`. 

The assertion `//@ assert !(x % 2);` states that after the loop terminates, the value of `x` must be even. This implies that at each iteration of the loop, `x` is an even number. Therefore, we can use this property as our loop invariant:
```c
/*@ requires true;
   @ ensures  \result == !(x % 2);
   @ assigns  x;
*/
int f(int x) { ... } // Replace with the actual implementation of function 'f'

//@ loop invariant mask : (X == (x &~ 1));
```
In this case, `X` is defined as `(x &~ 1)`, which means that all bits in `x` are kept except for the least significant bit. This ensures that at each iteration of the loop, `x` remains even.

=========================================

array_2-1-simple.c
In this code, the loop is used to copy elements from array A into array B. Since we are only modifying the values of arrays A and B within the loop, we can use the following invariant:
//@ loop invariant  \forall integer j in 0..i; A[j] == B[j];
This invariant states that for all indices up to i (inclusive), the corresponding elements in both arrays are equal. Since this is true before and after each iteration of the loop, it remains an invariant throughout the execution of the loop. After the loop finishes executing, we can assert that A[SZ/2] != B[SZ/2], which means that the copy operation was successful as the original array values are not equal to the copied ones at index SZ/2 (which is 1024th element in this case).

=========================================

simple_3-2.c
In this code, the loop iterates until a variable `x` reaches or exceeds a value of `N`. The loop increments `x` by 2 in each iteration. Since `x` is initially set to 0 and incremented by 2 at every step, it will always be an even number inside the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : x == N * 2 || (x > N && x % 2 == 0);

This loop invariant states that either `x` is equal to twice the value of `N`, or if `x` exceeds `N`, it must be an even number. This ensures that the loop terminates when `x` equals `N * 2` and maintains the invariance throughout the execution of the loop.

=========================================

underapprox_1-2.c
In this loop, the variable `y` is being doubled until `x` reaches or exceeds 6. Since we are only interested in the remainder of `y` when divided by 3, we can use that as our invariant. The computed invariant for this annotated loop would be:
//@ loop invariant mask : y % 3 == x - 1;

=========================================

simple_4-2.c
In this code, the loop is decrementing the value of 'x' by 2 until it becomes zero. The final assertion states that 'x' should be an even number after the loop exits. Therefore, a suitable loop invariant for this loop could be:
//@ loop invariant \valid(x + (0 - i));
//@ loop invariant x >= 0;
//@ loop invariant !((x % 2) && (i > 0));
//@ loop invariant !(x % 4); // The loop invariant states that 'x' is divisible by 4. This means it will always be an even number, satisfying the final assertion.

=========================================

underapprox_2-1.c
In this code, the loop invariant is that after each iteration of the loop, the value of `y` is equal to 2 raised to the power of the current value of `x`. This can be expressed as:
```c
//@ loop invariant mask : y == POW2(x);
```
Here, `POW2()` represents a function that calculates 2 raised to the power of its argument.

=========================================

simple_2-2.c
In this code, the loop is incrementing a variable 'x' until it reaches or exceeds 0x0fffffff. Since we are starting with an arbitrary value for 'x', and then continuously increasing its value in each iteration of the while-loop, the invariant should express that 'x' will always be less than 0x0fffffff before entering the loop body (since it is currently equal to or greater than this value), but once inside the loop, 'x' can only increase.
//@ loop invariant mask : x <= 0x0fffffff;

In other words: "At every iteration of the while-loop, 'x' will be less than or equal to 0x0fffffff." This is a valid ACSL annotation for this code snippet and ensures that the assertion at the end of the function holds.

=========================================

array_3-1.c
The loop invariant is:
//@ loop invariant mask : \false ;

To compute the loop invariant, we need to analyze the loop and its effects on the variables. The loop iterates over the array A until it finds a 0 value or reaches the end of the array (i == N-1). Since the initial value of i is 0, the loop will always terminate because there must be at least one 0 in the array due to its definition and size.

The invariant mask \false means that no useful invariant could be found for this specific code snippet. This might happen when the code does not have a clear pattern or property that remains true throughout the loop execution, making it difficult to find an appropriate invariant.

=========================================

phases_2-1.c

  unsigned int y = __VERIFIER_nondet_uint();

  while (x < y) {
    //@ loop invariant: x >= 2 && x <= y;
    //@ loop invariant: \exists k : x == 2^k || x == 2^k + 1;
    if (x < y / x) {
      x *= x;
    } else {
      x++;
    }
  }

//@ assert x != y;
}

=========================================

array_2-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given annotated loop, we need to analyze what is happening inside the loop and how it affects the variables. In this case:

1. The loop iterates over all elements of arrays A and B from index 0 to SZ-1 (2048 in this case).
2. Inside the loop, a temporary variable `tmp` stores the value at position i in array A.
3. Then, the value stored in `tmp` is assigned to the same position in array B.

The invariant should cover both arrays and their relationship with each other. Since we know that inside the loop, every element of B will be equal to the corresponding element of A at the beginning of the iteration (due to the assignment), our invariant can focus on this fact:

//@ loop invariant  \forall int j; 0 <= j < SZ; (\old(B[j]) == B[j] && A[j] == \old(A[j])) || (i == j && A[j] == tmp);

This invariant states that for every index `j` in the range [0, SZ), either:
- Before this iteration of the loop (denoted by `\old()`), B[j] was equal to its current value and so was A[j], or
- If the current index `i` is equal to `j`, then A[j] holds the same value as tmp, which will be assigned to B[j] in this iteration.

=========================================

const_1-1.c
In this code, the loop does not modify the value of 'x' or use it in any way. Therefore, we can choose an invariant that doesn't involve 'x'. Let's consider the variable 'y':
```c
int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 1;
  unsigned int y = 0;

  while (y < 1024) {
    //@ loop invariant : y == Y ;
    y++;
  }

//@ assert x == 0;
}
```
Here, we choose the invariant 'Y' to be equal to 'y'. This means that at each iteration of the loop, 'y' is equal to 'Y', and this property holds before entering the loop (when 'y' equals 0). Since 'y' gets incremented by one in each iteration, it will always remain less than 1024.

After the loop, since 'x' was not modified during the execution of the loop, we can assert that 'x' is equal to 0:
```c
int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 1;
  unsigned int y = 0;

  while (y < 1024) {
    //@ loop invariant : y == Y ;
    y++;
  }
//@ assert x == 0;
}
```

=========================================

simple_3-1.c
//@ loop invariant mask : x == 0 || even(x);

int main(void) {
  unsigned int x = 0;
  unsigned short N = __VERIFIER_nondet_ushort();

  while (x < N) {
    x += 2;
  }

  //@ assert x % 2;
}

=========================================

multivar_1-2.c
In this code, the loop iterates until `x` reaches a value of 1024. During each iteration, both `x` and `y` are incremented by one. The goal is to prove that when the loop terminates, `x` will be equal to `y`. To express this as an invariant, we can say:

//@ loop invariant mask : x == y;

=========================================

multivar_1-1.c
In this code, we have a loop that increments the values of both 'x' and 'y' until 'x' is no longer less than 1024. The goal is to prove that 'x' equals 'y' after the loop terminates. We can create an invariant for this loop as follows:
//@ loop invariant y == x;
This invariant states that at every iteration of the loop, the value of 'y' will be equal to the current value of 'x'. Since we are incrementing both 'x' and 'y' by 1 in each iteration, this invariant holds true. After the loop terminates, since it does so when 'x' is no longer less than 1024, the final values of 'x' and 'y' will be equal according to our invariant.

=========================================

overflow_1-1.c
In this code, the loop is iterating as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 10. The only operation inside the loop is adding 2 to `x`. Since we are adding an even number (2) to `x`, it means that `x` will always be an even number after each iteration of the loop.

array_3-2.c
The loop invariant is that the loop variable i is less than or equal to N/2. This can be achieved by adding a check in the for loop to see if i is less than or equal to N/2 before proceeding with the loop. The updated code would look like this:
```
#define N 10024

int main(void) {
  int A[N];
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    A[i] = __VERIFIER_nondet_int();

model: Orca 2 (Medium)
array_3-2.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables in the loop. In this case, there are two loops, and the second one depends on the result of the first one. The first loop generates random integers for the array A, while the second loop checks if any element of A is not zero.

The invariant we want to prove is that i is always less than or equal to N/2 after each iteration of the outer loop. This means that at most half of the elements in A are non-zero. To do this, we can use a modulo operation on i and N, which preserves the inequality relation:

i < N / 2
i % N <= N / 2

Now let's analyze each iteration of the outer loop:

1. When A[0] = __VERIFIER_nondet_int(), i = 0, and i < N is true. So we have i % N <= N / 2, which holds.
2. When A[i] = __VERIFIER_nondet_int() for i > 0, i < N is still true. So we have i % N <= N / 2, which continues to hold.
3. When the outer loop ends and there are no more elements in A that are not zero, i = N - 1 (since i < N) and i % N = 1. However, this is still less than or equal to N / 2, so we have i % N <= N / 2, which holds.

Therefore, the loop invariant for the annotated loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###@preserve

=========================================

functions_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is x < 0x0fffffff, which means that the value of x will always decrease or stay the same in each iteration. The update expression is f(x), which applies some function to the current value of x.

Since the function applied to x does not change its parity (i.e., whether it's even or odd), we can use the modulo operator (%) to check if x is divisible by 2 in each iteration, and thus keep track of whether x is even or odd. Therefore, a valid loop invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x >= 0;
X = x % 2 == 1; // If x is odd, then X is true

=========================================

simple_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the value of x. The loop condition is x < 0x0fffffff and the update expression is x += 2. Let's see what happens in each iteration:

- Initially, x = 0
- In the first iteration, x becomes 2 (since x += 2)
- In the second iteration, x becomes 4 (since x += 2 again)
- In the third iteration, x becomes 6 (since x += 2 once more)
- And so on...

The loop will continue until x reaches 0x0fffffff. At that point, the update expression will no longer increase x by 2 because it would go beyond the maximum value of a unsigned int in C, which is 0x0ffffff. Therefore, the loop will terminate and x will have the value 0x0fffffff - 2 = 0x0fffffff (since we added 2 twice).

Now let's check if the loop invariant holds true for each iteration:

- Before the first iteration, the invariant is false since x < 0.
- After the first iteration, the invariant becomes true since x >= 0 and remains true for every subsequent iteration until the end of the loop.

Therefore, a possible loop invariant mask can be written as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ; // where X is the computed invariant (which in this case is simply X = true)

=========================================

simple_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and update expression of the while loop. The condition is x < 0x0fffffff, which means that the value of x will always decrease or stay the same after each iteration. The update expression is x += 2, which adds 2 to the current value of x in every iteration.

Since x is unsigned and has a maximum value of 0x0fffffff, adding 2 to it can only increase its value by at most 2. Therefore, we cannot have x % 2 == true (i.e., x is divisible by 2) after each iteration. This means that the loop invariant for this code should always be true:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

The final answer is:

###Answer: //@ loop invariant mask : false ;

=========================================

array_4.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables in the loop. In this case, there are two loops and one assignment statement that affects the values of A[i]. The first loop generates random integers for A[i] from 0 to N-1 using __VERIFIER_nondet_int(). The second loop checks if any element of A is not equal to zero.

The invariant we can compute for this code is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i <= N;
X = (i == 0) || (A[i] != 0);

This invariant states that either the initial condition of i being zero or any element of A not being equal to zero, both hold for all values of i from 0 to N-1.

=========================================

underapprox_2-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and how it affects the variables. The loop iterates until x reaches 6. Inside the loop, x is incremented by 1 in each iteration, while y is multiplied by 2. Here are the steps of the computation:

//@ before (x = 0, y = 1) ;
//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ after (x = 6, y = 4) ;

The loop invariant should capture the state of the variables at any point during the iteration. In this case, we can use x as the invariant since it is modified inside the loop and reaches a fixed value at the end of the loop. Therefore, the invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = 6

=========================================

underapprox_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and how it affects the variables involved. The loop iterates until x reaches 6, which means that at least one iteration is executed. Inside the loop, y is multiplied by 2 in each iteration. This operation will always reduce the value of y, unless there is a zero-division error (which is not possible since y cannot be zero initially). Therefore, after the loop ends, y must have a non-zero value that is less than or equal to 64.

To express this invariant in ACSL notation, we can use the following template:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

In this case, the invariant can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant y != 0 ;

=========================================

array_2-2-simple.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables involved in the loop. In this case, there are two variables, A and B, which are being copied from one array to another using a temporary variable, tmp. The loop iterates SZ times, so at least half of the elements will be copied correctly (i.e., from A[0] to B[0], A[1] to B[1], ..., A[SZ/2 - 1] to B[SZ/2 - 1]).

The rest of the elements might not be copied correctly due to some unspecified reason (e.g., a bug in the code or an unexpected behavior). Therefore, we cannot guarantee that all elements are copied correctly for every iteration. Thus, there is no loop invariant that holds true for each iteration of this loop.

However, if we assume that at least half of the elements are always copied correctly, then we can define a loop invariant as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : A[0:SZ/2];

This means that after every iteration of the loop, the array A has the same elements as the first SZ/2 elements of the array B. This is a reasonable assumption given the nature of the code and the fact that it works correctly in some cases.

=========================================

array3.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to analyze the loop and determine what value does not change within the loop. In this case, the loop is iterating over an array A with indices from 0 to N-1, where N is the size of the array. The loop is also checking if i is less than or equal to N before continuing.

The invariant we can compute for this loop is that the index of the current element in the iteration is valid and does not exceed the bounds of the array A. We can express this as:

//@ loop invariant mask : i ;

In other words, the value of i remains within the range [0; N-1] during the execution of the loop.

=========================================

nested_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the condition and body of each loop. The first loop has the condition x < 0x0fffffff and the body is y = 0. The second loop has the condition y < 10 and the body is y++.

The loop invariant should capture the state of a variable after each iteration of the loop. In this case, we can use the value of x as our loop invariant since it changes in every iteration of both loops. We also need to include the condition for the second while loop that updates y. Therefore, the loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x >= 0) * ((y > 9) & (!(y % 2)))

=========================================

phases_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and body of the while loop. The condition is x < 0x0fffffff, which means that the variable x will take values from 0 up to 0x0fffffff - 1. The body of the loop consists of two branches:

- If x < 0xfff1, then x++ is executed, incrementing x by 1. This ensures that x increases by 1 in each iteration where this condition is true.
- Otherwise, if x >= 0xfff1, then x += 2 is executed, increasing x by 2 in each iteration where this condition is false (i.e., when the loop counter reaches 0xfffffffd).

Based on these observations, we can compute a loop invariant that represents the value of x after each iteration. The invariant should be true for all iterations except one: when the loop counter reaches 0xfffffffd and the condition x >= 0xfff1 is false. In this case, the invariant will not hold because x will have increased by 2 instead of 1 in that iteration.

The loop invariant can be expressed as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x < 0xfffffffd ;
//@ ensures !(X % 2);

This means that the value of X (which is equivalent to x) will always be even after each iteration, except when the loop counter reaches 0xfffffffd and the condition x >= 0xfff1 is false. In this case, X may not be even because it has increased by 2 instead of 1 in that iteration.

Therefore, the final answer for the computed invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x < 0xfffffffd ;
//@ ensures !(X % 2);

const_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is `y < 1024` and the update expression is `x = 0`. Let's break down the loop iteration step by step:

1. Initially, x has value 1 and y has value 0.
2. In the first iteration, y becomes 1 (since it must be greater than or equal to 1024). The update expression `x = 0` is executed. After this execution, x remains unchanged at 1, but y increases by 1. So far, we have:
   - x = 1
   - y = 1
3. In the second iteration, y becomes 2 (since it must be greater than or equal to 1024). The update expression `x = 0` is executed again. After this execution, x remains unchanged at 1, but y increases by 1. So far, we have:
   - x = 1
   - y = 2
4. In the third iteration, y becomes 3 (since it must be greater than or equal to 1024). The update expression `x = 0` is executed again. After this execution, x remains unchanged at 1, but y increases by 1. So far, we have:
   - x = 1
   - y = 3
5. In the fourth iteration, y becomes 4 (since it must be greater than or equal to 1024). The update expression `x = 0` is executed again. After this execution, x remains unchanged at 1, but y increases by 1. So far, we have:
   - x = 1
   - y = 4
6. In the fifth iteration, y becomes 5 (since it must be greater than or equal to 1024). The update expression `x = 0` is executed again. After this execution, x remains unchanged at 1, but y increases by 1. So far, we have:
   - x = 1
   - y = 5
7. In the sixth iteration, y becomes 6 (since it must be greater than or equal to 10

=========================================

simple_2-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the value of x. The loop condition is x < 0x0fffffff and the update is x++. This means that every time the loop runs, x becomes either equal to or greater than 0x0fffffff. Therefore, the invariant for this loop can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (unsigned int) (x >= 0x0fffffff);

=========================================

phases_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and body of the while loop. The condition is x < 0x0fffffff, which means that the variable x will take values from 0 up to 0x0fffffff - 1 (inclusive). The body of the loop updates the value of x based on two different cases:

- If x is less than or equal to 0xfff0, then it increments by 1. This means that after each iteration, x will be one more than its previous value in the range [0, 0xfffffff - 1].
- If x is greater than 0xfff0, then it adds 2 and assigns it back to x. This means that after each iteration, x will take values from 0xfffffff up to 0x100000000 (inclusive).

Now let's consider the invariant for x in both cases:

- When x is less than or equal to 0xfffffff - 1, then it holds that x % 2 == 0. This means that x is a multiple of 2 and has no remainder when divided by 2. We can write this as an invariant: x % 2 == 0 for all values of x in the loop.
- When x is greater than or equal to 0x100000000, then it holds that x % 2 != 0. This means that x is not a multiple of 2 and has a remainder when divided by 2. We can write this as another invariant: x % 2 != 0 for all values of x in the loop.

Since these two invariants are true at different points during the execution of the loop, we cannot combine them into one single invariant using ACSL notation (X;). However, we can use a conditional expression to express both cases: X = (x % 2 == 0) ? "invariant1" : "invariant2";

Therefore, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (x % 2 == 0) ? "invariant1" : "invariant2";

=========================================

simple_4-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the value of x. The loop condition is x > 1 and the update expression is x -= 2. Let's see what happens in each iteration:

- Initially, x = 0x0ffffff1 which is greater than 1. So, the loop starts with the first iteration.
- In this iteration, x -= 2 will decrease x by 2, making it 0x0ffffff3 (since 0x0ffffff1 - 2 = 0x0ffffff3). Since x is still greater than 1, the loop continues for another iteration.
- In the second iteration, x -= 2 will again decrease x by 2, making it 0x0fffffff5 (since 0x0ffffff3 - 2 = 0x0fffffff5). Since x is still greater than 1, the loop continues for another iteration.
- In the third iteration, x -= 2 will again decrease x by 2, making it 0x0fffffga7 (since 0x0ffffff3 - 2 = 0x0fffffga7). Since x is still greater than 1, the loop continues for another iteration.
- In the fourth iteration, x -= 2 will again decrease x by 2, making it 0x0fffffgab8 (since 0x0fffffga7 - 2 = 0x0fffffgab8). Since x is still greater than 1, the loop continues for another iteration.
- In the fifth iteration, x -= 2 will again decrease x by 2, making it 0x0ffffgagbc9 (since 0x0fffffga7 - 2 = 0x0ffffgagbc9). Since x is still greater than 1, the loop continues for another iteration.
- In the sixth iteration, x -= 2 will again decrease x by 2, making it 0x0ffffgabhij10 (since 0x0ffffgagbc9 - 2 = 0x0ffffgabhij10). Since x is still greater than 1, the loop continues for another iteration.
- In the seventh iteration

=========================================

nested_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop conditions and updates. The main loop iterates while `x < 0x0fffffff`, which means that it will run as long as x is not equal to or greater than 2^14 (i.e., 8192). The inner loop iterates while `y < 10`, which means that it will run for at most 10 iterations.

The main loop updates the value of x by incrementing it, and the inner loop updates the value of y by incrementing it. Therefore, both loops have a common invariant: the values of x and y are always increasing in each iteration. This means that after any iteration, either x or y will be greater than their previous values.

Based on this analysis, we can compute an invariant for the main loop as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###define invariant as: 
X = (x >= 0) and (y > 9)

This means that after any iteration of the main loop, either x or y will be non-negative and greater than 9, respectively. This can be expressed in ACSL notation using a mask to indicate what values are valid for X at each iteration. The final invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : (x >= 0) and (y > 9);

=========================================

functions_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and the body of the while loop. The condition is x < 0x0fffffff, which means that the variable x will only take negative values in this loop. The body of the loop updates the value of x by calling the function f(x), which might modify it depending on the implementation of f().

Since we are interested in finding a loop invariant for x, we can focus on its initial and final values within the loop. Initially, x is 0 (as assigned to an unsigned int variable). After each iteration, the value of x will be updated by calling f(x), which might change it depending on the function's behavior.

However, since the condition for entering the loop requires that x < 0x0fffffff, and we are only updating x with a function call (which does not modify negative values as per the C standard), we can conclude that after each iteration of the loop, x will still be less than 0x0fffffff.

Therefore, based on this analysis, we can compute an invariant for x by saying that it remains in the range [0, 0x0fffffff] throughout the execution of the loop. This invariant is expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant.

###@end

=========================================

phases_2-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expression. The loop condition is x < y, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than y. The update expression depends on whether x < y / x or not. If it does, then x *= x; otherwise, x++;.

Let's consider two cases:
1. When x < y and x < y / x, the loop will run once for each iteration of while (x < y). In this case, the invariant is that x == y at the end of each iteration. This can be expressed as X[0] = 1; X[1] = 2 * X[0]; X[2] = 3 * X[0]; ... until X[n] = n * X[0], where n is the number of iterations.

2. When x < y but x > y / x, the loop will run once for each iteration of while (x < y) and then an additional iteration after incrementing x. In this case, the invariant is that x == y + 1 at the end of each iteration. This can be expressed as X[0] = 1; X[1] = 2 * X[0]; X[2] = 3 * X[0]; ... until X[n] = n * X[0], where n is the number of iterations, plus one for the additional iteration.

Therefore, the loop invariant mask can be written as:
//@ loop invariant mask : if (x < y and x < y / x) then 2 * X[0]; else 1 ; end if; //@

=========================================

array_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to find an expression that is true for every iteration of the loop. In this case, let's consider the variable i as our loop index and A[i] as our loop value. The loop invariant should be related to these two variables only. 

We can see from the code that A[0] = 0, A[1] = 1, ..., A[999] = 999, A[1000] = 1000, and A[1023] = 1023. Since i goes from 0 to 1023 in the loop, we can conclude that A[i] is equal to i for every iteration of the loop.

Therefore, a valid loop invariant mask for this code is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = A[i];

=========================================

array_2-1-simple.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables involved. In this case, there are two variables, A and B, which are both arrays of size SZ. The loop copies the elements of array A to array B using temporary variable tmp. 

The loop invariant should capture the state of the arrays after each iteration. Since we are copying elements from one array to another, no change is made to either array in this operation. Therefore, the invariant remains unchanged for every iteration. The invariant can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : A ;

This means that at any point during or after the execution of the loop, the value of variable A will always be true (i.e., it contains no changes).

=========================================

diamond_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is x < 99, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than 99. The update expression depends on whether y is even or odd. If y is even, then x becomes one more when the loop runs. If y is odd, then x increases by two when the loop runs.

We can use a variable to store the invariant and update it after each iteration of the loop. Let's call this variable inv. We initialize inv to 0 before entering the loop. Then we check if y % 2 == 0. If so, then x becomes one more, which means that inv remains unchanged. However, since x is incremented by one in every iteration, we can say that inv >= 1 for all iterations of the loop. This implies that inv is a loop invariant.

If y % 2 != 0, then x increases by two, meaning that inv becomes one more than x before each iteration. Therefore, inv < x for all iterations of the loop. This also means that inv is a loop invariant.

Since we want to use ACSL annotations, we can write our final answer as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X is the computed invariant. In this case, either 1 or x (depending on whether y % 2 == 0 or not), since inv >= 1 for all iterations of the loop and inv < x.

=========================================

array_2-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effects of each iteration on the variables involved. We can use the following steps:

- Identify the loop variable i and its initial value (i = 0)
- Identify the loop condition (i < SZ) that limits the range of iterations
- Identify the statements executed in each iteration, which are: A[i] = __VERIFIER_nondet_int() and B[i] = __VERIFIER_nondet_int()
- Analyze how these statements affect the variables A and B. Since they are nondeterministic ints, there is no guarantee that any pair of consecutive elements will have a consistent relationship. Therefore, we cannot compute an invariant based on the current value of i or its previous values. The only thing we know for sure is that each element in A has a different value than the corresponding element in B at any iteration.
- Conclude that there is no loop invariant for this annotated loop using __VERIFIER_nondet_int() statements, as they do not preserve any meaningful relationship between adjacent elements of A and B.

###@loop invariant mask : X; // No valid invariant can be computed

=========================================

diamond_2-2.c
The loop invariant for the given code is X = y modulo 2, where y is the input of the nondet_uint function. This means that at any iteration of the while loop, x will have the same parity as y, i.e., if y is even, then x will be even and vice versa.

Here is the loop invariant in ACSL notation:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

Some additional information or context for this answer would be:

The while loop iterates 98 times due to the nondet_uint function, which generates a random integer between 0 and 65535. Each iteration of the loop updates x based on whether y is even or odd. If y is even, then x will also be even after adding 2 in each odd-y case, while if y is odd, then x will also be odd after subtracting 4 in each odd-y case. Therefore, at any iteration of the loop, X = y modulo 2, which means that their parity matches.

=========================================

simple_3-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and update of the loop. The condition is x < N, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than some value N (which can be any positive integer). The update of the loop is x += 2, which increases the value of x by 2 in each iteration.

Since x is always incremented by 2 in every iteration, we cannot have a remainder when dividing it by 2. Therefore, the invariant for this loop should be that x % 2 == 0 (x is divisible by 2). This means that after each iteration of the loop, x will either remain unchanged or increase by exactly one unit.

Here is the final answer:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires x < N ;
//@ ensures X % 2 == 0 ;

###include verifier library;

=========================================

diamond_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and body of the while loop. The condition is x < 99, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than 99. The body of the loop consists of two branches depending on the value of y modulo 2:

- If y % 2 == 0, then x += 2, meaning that x increases by 2 in each iteration. This means that x will always be even after each iteration.
- Otherwise, if y % 2 != 0, then x++ is executed, which means that x will increase by 1 in each iteration. However, since the loop condition requires x to be less than 99, this branch of the loop can only run once before the while loop terminates. Therefore, after one iteration, x must be odd and greater than or equal to 1 (since it was initially 0).

Based on these observations, we can compute an invariant for the loop as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : even ;

This means that at the end of each iteration, the value of X is always an even number.

=========================================

underapprox_1-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables involved in the loop. The loop variable is x and it has an initial value of 0. The while loop will execute as long as x is less than 6. In each iteration, x increases by 1 and y doubles.

Let's break down the execution for each iteration:

- Iteration 1: x = 0 + 1 = 1, y = 2 * 1 = 2 (doubles)
- Iteration 2: x = 1 + 1 = 2, y = 4 * 2 = 8 (doubles)
- Iteration 3: x = 2 + 1 = 3, y = 8 * 2 = 16 (doubles)
- Iteration 4: x = 3 + 1 = 4, y = 16 * 2 = 32 (doubles)
- Iteration 5: x = 4 + 1 = 5, y = 32 * 2 = 64 (doubles)
- Iteration 6: x = 5 + 1 = 6, y = 64 * 2 = 128 (doubles)

At the end of each iteration, we can see that both variables change in some way. However, since the loop condition is only checking if x < 6 and not if x == 6 or x > 6, the loop will continue to execute until x reaches 6. Therefore, there is no loop invariant for this code as long as the while loop condition holds true.

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

=========================================

simple_4-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the value of x. The loop condition is x > 0 and the update expression is x -= 2. Let's see what happens in each iteration:

- Initially, x = 0x0ffffff0 which is greater than zero, so the loop starts.
- In the first iteration, x -= 2 decreases the value of x by 2. Since x > 0, this operation is valid and does not violate the loop condition. After this iteration, we have x = 0x0ffffff2 which is still greater than zero. The invariant for this iteration can be expressed as: x >= 0
- In the second iteration, x -= 2 decreases the value of x by 4. Since x > 0, this operation is valid and does not violate the loop condition. After this iteration, we have x = 0x0ffffff6 which is still greater than zero. The invariant for this iteration can be expressed as: x >= 0
- In the third iteration, x -= 2 decreases the value of x by 6. Since x > 0, this operation is valid and does not violate the loop condition. After this iteration, we have x = 0x0ffffff8 which is still greater than zero. The invariant for this iteration can be expressed as: x >= 0
- In the fourth iteration, x -= 2 decreases the value of x by 8. Since x > 0, this operation is valid and does not violate the loop condition. After this iteration, we have x = 0x0fffffff which is still greater than zero. The invariant for this iteration can be expressed as: x >= 0
- In the fifth iteration, x -= 2 decreases the value of x by 10. Since x > 0, this operation is valid and does not violate the loop condition. After this iteration, we have x = 0x0fffffe0 which is still greater than zero. The invariant for this iteration can be expressed as: x >= 0
- In the sixth iteration, x -= 2 decreases the value of x by 12. Since x > 0, this operation is valid and does not violate the loop condition.

=========================================

underapprox_2-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the condition and body of the while loop. The condition is x < 6, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than 6. The body of the loop updates both x and y variables. Let's examine what happens in each iteration:

- In the first iteration, x = 0, so the condition is true. We increment x by 1 (x becomes 1) and multiply y by 2 (y becomes 2). The invariant for this iteration would be X_inv = x + "=" + y * "*" 1, which simplifies to X_inv = 1 + 2*1 or X_inv = 3.
- In the second iteration, x = 1, so the condition is still true. We increment x by 1 (x becomes 2) and multiply y by 2 again (y becomes 4). The invariant for this iteration would be X_inv = x + "=" + y * "*" 2, which simplifies to X_inv = 2 + 4*1 or X_inv = 6.
- In the third iteration, x = 2, so the condition is still true. We increment x by 1 (x becomes 3) and multiply y by 2 once more (y becomes 8). The invariant for this iteration would be X_inv = x + "=" + y * "*" 3, which simplifies to X_inv = 3 + 8*1 or X_inv = 11.
- In the fourth iteration, x = 3, so the condition is still true. We increment x by 1 (x becomes 4) and multiply y by 2 for the last time (y becomes 16). The invariant for this iteration would be X_inv = x + "=" + y * "*" 4, which simplifies to X_inv = 4 + 16*1 or X_inv = 20.
- In the fifth and sixth iterations, x is not less than 6 anymore, so the condition becomes false and the loop terminates.

Based on this analysis, we can conclude that for any iteration of the loop except the last two, the invariant would be equal to y^n *

=========================================

simple_2-2.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the effect of each statement in the loop. The loop condition is x < 0x0fffffff and the update expression is x++.

The initial value of x is unpredictable due to the use of __VERIFIER_nondet_uint(), but it must be less than or equal to 0x0fffffff for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, we can assume that x >= 0x0fffffff after the first iteration of the loop.

The loop body increments x by 1 in each iteration. This means that x will keep increasing until it reaches or exceeds 0x0fffffff and then wrap around to become negative again. However, since we are only interested in the loop invariant for a single iteration, we can ignore this edge case and focus on the first positive value of x after the loop starts.

Based on these observations, we can compute the following loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ loop invariant X = 0x0fffffff;

=========================================

array_3-1.c
To compute a loop invariant, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the value of X. In this case, X is an integer variable that represents some property or condition that remains true throughout the execution of the loop. We can use the following steps to find a suitable loop invariant for this code:

1. Identify the initial values of all variables involved in the loop. Here, A is an array with elements initialized to 0 and i is initially 0.
2. Examine each iteration of the outer loop that modifies the value of X. In this case, the inner loop assigns a non-zero value to each element of A using __VERIFIER_nondet_int(), which is an unpredictable value generator. This means that no matter what value we choose for i, the array will be reshuffled in some way after each iteration of the outer loop.
3. Determine if there exists a condition or property that remains true throughout all iterations of both loops. In this case, since A[i] is non-zero and i <= N, we can use these conditions to form an invariant for the inner loop. However, note that using only these conditions would not be sufficient to ensure that X remains unchanged during each iteration of the outer loop, as the value of A changes in every iteration due to the reshuffling effect caused by __VERIFIER_nondet_int().
4. Combine any additional conditions or properties that are true throughout both loops into a single invariant for the entire loop. In this case, we can use the condition i <= N as an additional property that holds during each iteration of the outer loop and does not change due to the reshuffling effect. Therefore, our final loop invariant is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
where X = A[i] != 0 AND i <= N;

=========================================

phases_2-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is x < y, which means that the loop will run as long as x is less than y. The update expression depends on whether x reaches y / x or not. If it does, then x *= x; otherwise, x++;.

We can use a variable to track the minimum value of x after each iteration. Let's call this variable min_x and initialize it with x = 1. Then we can update min_x whenever x reaches y / x or increases by 1. Here is how the loop invariant changes as the loop iterates:

Iteration | Loop Invariant
-----------------------
0         | X < y
1         | (X >= y/X) ? true : false
2         | ((X >= y/X) && (min_x == x))? true : false
3         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
4         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
5         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
6         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
7         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
8         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
9         | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false
10        | ((X >= y/X) || (min_x > x))? true : false

We can see that the loop invariant changes after each iteration, except for when min_x is updated. Therefore, we can write the following loop invariant:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

The final value of X depends on whether y / x ever occurs or not. If it does, then X = 1; otherwise, X = 2.

=========================================

array_2-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effects of each iteration on the variables involved. In this case, there are two loops, one that initializes A and B with random values, and another that copies the value from A to B. The first loop does not preserve any order or relation between the elements in A and B, while the second loop preserves their relationship by copying the same value.

The invariant for this loop is that no element of A has a corresponding element in B at the end of each iteration. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ requires i < SZ;
//@ ensures A[i] != B[i];

=========================================

const_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze the loop condition and update expressions. The loop condition is `y < 1024` and the update expression is `x = 0`. Let's break down the loop iteration step by step:

1. Initially, x has value 1 and y has value 0.
2. In each iteration, y is incremented by 1, so after each iteration, y becomes greater than or equal to 1 (since it needs to be less than 1024 in the next iteration).
3. At the same time, x is assigned a new value of 0 before each iteration. This means that no matter what value y has, x will always take on the value 0 after every iteration.
4. Therefore, we can conclude that for any value of y between 0 and 1023, x will also be equal to 0 at the end of the loop. In other words, there exists an integer k such that x = 0 whenever y >= k. This is a valid invariant for this loop.

So, the final answer is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
//@ assert x == 0;

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the effect of each iteration on the variables involved. In this case, there are only two variables, x and y, which are incremented in every iteration of the while loop. The condition of the while loop is that x must be less than 1024.

We can observe that after each iteration, both x and y will increase by one. Since the value of x does not change within the loop, we can conclude that at the end of every iteration, x == y holds true. Therefore, the invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

To show how the invariant is computed, let's use a table to represent the values of x and y after each iteration:

| Iteration | x  | y   |
|-----------|----|-----|
| 1         | 0  | 1   |
| 2         | 1  | 2   |
| 3         | 2  | 3   |
| ...       | ... | ... |
| n         | n-1 | n   |

As we can see, after each iteration, x and y have the same value. Thus, at the end of every iteration, x == y holds true. Therefore, the loop invariant is X = (x >= 0 && x < 1024).

multivar_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the annotated loop, we need to analyze the statements inside the loop and determine if they preserve some property of the loop variables. In this case, the loop variable is x, which increases by 1 in each iteration. The while loop condition checks that x < 1024 before incrementing both x and y.

Since x is always incremented before y, we can conclude that after each iteration, x will be equal to y + 1. Therefore, the invariant for this loop is:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;
X = (y >= 0) ? ((x < 1024) ? (x - 1) : (y - 1)) : (-((x - 1) <= y));

overflow_1-1.c
To compute a loop invariant for the given code, we need to analyze what happens inside the loop and how it affects the variable x. The loop condition is x >= 10, which means that the loop will run as long as x is greater than or equal to 10. Inside the loop, the value of x is incremented by 2 each iteration.

The invariant for this loop can be expressed in terms of the variable x and its relation with the condition. We know that if a number is even (divisible by 2), then it will increase by 2 when added to itself. Therefore, we can say:

//@ loop invariant mask : X ;

In this case, X = "x >= 10 and x % 2 == false" which means that the value of x is greater than or equal to 10 and it is not divisible by 2 (odd). This invariant holds true for each iteration of the loop.
