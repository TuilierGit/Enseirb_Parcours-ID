The loop invariant is that the difference between `x` and `n` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop.

//@ loop invariant mask : y == n - x;
underapprox_1-2.c
The desired invariant is that the value of `y` at each iteration is equal to twice the previous value. This can be expressed as follows:

//@ loop invariant mask : (x == i && y == 2^i) ;
benchmark04_conjunctive.c
The loop invariant is that the difference between `k` and `n` remains constant throughout the execution of the loop. This can be expressed as:

//@ loop invariant mask : k - n; 

This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, we have `k - n = initial_value`, where `initial_value` is the value of `k - n` before entering the loop.

The reason for this invariant is that in each iteration of the loop, both `j` and `k` are incremented by 1, while `n` remains constant. Therefore, the difference between `k` and `n`, which is initially equal to `n-1`, decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0 when `k` becomes less than or equal to `n`.

//@ loop invariant mask : \false;

After analyzing the code, we can see that there is no loop in this function. The if statement checks for the termination condition of the while loop: n >= 1 && k >= n && j == 0. However, since there's no actual loop present in the given code snippet, it's impossible to compute a valid ACSL invariant for it.

The computed loop invariant for the given annotated loop is:
//@ loop invariant mask : y == n ;
This means that after each iteration of the loop, the value of `y` will be equal to the original input value `n`.
underapprox_1-2.c
The annotated loop in the given C code is as follows:
```c
void func() {
  unsigned int x = 0, y = 1;
  // @ loop invariant mask : (x <= 6) && (y == 2^n || y == 4*n+1) ;
  while (x < 6) { x++; y *= 2; }
  assert(y % 3 != 0);
}
```
The loop invariant is computed as follows:
- The loop invariant mask `(x <= 6) && (y == 2^n || y == 4*n+1)` states that the loop invariant holds at each iteration of the loop.
- At the beginning of the loop, we have `x = 0` and `y = 1`. Therefore, `(x <= 6) && (y == 2^n || y == 4*n+1)` is true.
- After executing the loop body once, we have `x = 1` and `y = 2`. Since `y % 3 != 0`, the assertion holds. Therefore, `(x <= 6) && (y == 2^n || y == 4*n+1)` is still true after executing the loop body once.
- After executing the loop body twice, we have `x = 2` and `y = 8`. Since `y % 3 != 0`, the assertion holds. Therefore, `(x <= 6) && (y == 2^n || y == 4*n+1)` is still true after executing the loop body twice.
- After executing the loop body three times, we have `x = 3` and `y = 32`. Since `y % 3 != 0`, the assertion holds. Therefore, `(x <= 6) && (y == 2^n || y == 4*n+1)` is still true after executing the loop body three times.
- After executing the loop body four times, we have `x = 4` and `y = 128`. Since `y % 3 != 0`, the assertion holds. Therefore, `
